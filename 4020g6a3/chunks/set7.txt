Your robot accomplished more in a short period of time than we did all year in focusing our children�s attention on what a wonderful machine the human body is.  I was fascinated with the almost complete mesmerization your robot drew. The lesson was excellent, the presentation medium fabulous.<BR>

<P>

For some of our students, it may have been the first time they considered the concept of themselves as being "very special" and individually worth more than a "million dollar machine". This enlightenment will surely trigger future reflections relative to personal values. I am sure the students will remember the robot�s positive upbeat learning experience for many years to come.<BR>

Our students left your program with a very positive outlook. The robot got their attention immediately and as a result they were ready to hear the message.  Many students indicated that they had never considered their bodies as a complicated machine which requires care to function properly.  This is one of the best, if not the best, assembly program ever presented to our students.<BR>

<P>The beauty of the program is that the technology captures children�s attention so they listen to the message.  If it was just a stiff robot with a recorded message, it just wouldn�t be nearly as effective. The interaction is what really gets to the kids.<BR>

<H3>Welcome to the Super Power Tour!</H3>



<UL>



<P>This page describes how <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personality (EP) robots</A>   interact with children in hospitals and other special care environments.  <BR>



<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../graphics/hosp_2.jpg">



<P>Since 1986, the biggest use for EP robots has been teaching children in elementary schools.  The <A HREF="../mdm/index.htm">Million Dollar Machine Program (MDM)</A> motivates children to care for their bodies, live healthy lives and achieve their personal best.  Please visit that site for extensive information on this successful program, now used by more than 2,200,000 children.<BR>

<P>The Super Power Tour is for children who can not attend regular schools. There are more than four million American children in special care situations including physically and mentally challenged children, and children living in hospitals and rehabilitation centers.<BR>

<P>If you haven�t yet experienced the magic of meeting one of our robots in person, please take a moment to read what professionals have to say about the Super Power Tour.  Their perspective will make the description below that much more meaningful.<BR>



<P>This page answers three questions:<BR>

<UL>

	<LI><A HREF="#EPSJob">What do robots do in hospitals?</A><BR>

	<P><LI><A HREF="#WhatIs">What is the Super Power Tour?</A><BR>

	<P><LI><A HREF="#GetOne">How can I bring a robot to my facility?</A><BR>

</UL>



<P>We prepared this material especially for healing professionals and parents of children in special care.  We hope that many of you will have the opportunity to try robotic media with your children and to help us discover new applications.  <BR>

<P>For more information, please <A HREF="../contact.htm">contact GoWell & Kent directly.</A><BR>



<A NAME="EPSJob"></A>

<H3>What do robots do in hospitals?</H3>

<UL><EM>

<P>Years ago, our robot was visiting patients in a Baltimore hospital.  One young girl had progeria, a disease that causes the body to age rapidly.  This 12 year old patient, with her perfectly normal 12 year old mind, was trapped in the wasting body of an 80 year old.  The staff expected her to die within weeks, which she knew.  As soon as she saw the robot, she became quick and sassy.  She and the robot had a great time joking, dancing and hugging.  We never forgot her smile, her laughter or our special friendship.  This program is the result.<BR>

</EM>

</UL>



<P>We don't have a miracle cure for children�s bodies, but we do have powerful healing lessons for their minds.  And an amazingly effective way to teach. <BR>

<P>Children naturally project themselves onto EP robots; girls and boys, young and old, black, white, brown and yellow.  In the blink of an eye, a robot can become a child's personal buddy who's cheering just for them!  <BR>

<P>A robot has another special quality In hospitals: it only projects love, hope, humor, and positive emotions.  A robot won�t change its expression or look away when it meets a burn victim.  A robot doesn't stare with pity or depression when meeting a child in chemotherapy who will die within a few months.  We use our robots to project love and strength.  <BR>

<P>To tell jokes.  To accept the children as they are.  To inspire them to believe in themselves.  And to teach kids how to give life their best shot. <BR>

<P>While humans often look at life support systems and wheelchairs with apprehension, robots look with familiarity . . . or even envy!  They show children that these life-saving machines that make them so different are actually prized possessions.  Stuff to be proud of!  An EEG becomes child's personal video game.  And wheelchairs?  Over the years, our robots have conducted as many wheelchair races as the Special Olympics.  And the funny thing is, the kids always win <BR>

. . . just by a hair!<BR>

<P>We use robots to give children a fresh, positive look at themselves . . . taught with warmth and energy.  These high-tech characters are also high-touch.  They motivate with love and laughter.  And they engage children in a very different way from adults.  <BR>

<P>The robot lessons always look at the brighter side of life and leave each children with lasting positive memories.  We use this rapport to teach children a special group of skills we call Super Powers.<BR>



<A NAME="WhatIs"></A>

<H3>What is the Super Power Tour?</H3>

<P>The Super Power Tour is a traveling educational program that uses robots to teach coping techniques and self esteem skills to children in special care situations.  The program visits children's hospitals, family retreats, special camps, rehabilitation centers and other caring facilities.  The robot teachers empower kids to be more positive about themselves, even in the face of difficult circumstances.<BR>

<P>The SPT program objectives are:<BR>

<OL>

	<LI>to bring  joy and laughter to kids when they need it most<BR>

	<P><LI>to interrupt patterns of pain, loneliness and sadness that young patients fall into<BR>

	<P><LI>to teach practical skills that enable children to confront their challenges and improve their moods<BR>

	<P><LI>to demonstrate positive new views of difficult situations,<BR>

	<P><LI>to draw children out and engage them in productive communication<BR>

	<P><LI>to encourage healing children to seek each other out and interact in a constructive manner<BR>

</OL>

<P>Through careful lesson design, child care professionals found inherent 'Super Power' skills that every child can master.  There are five techniques in all.  Each power is a meaningful exercise that promotes a positive mental attitude.  <BR>

<P>Easy exercises with muscle tone, breathing and smiling make a huge difference in energy and feelings.  The robot�s lessons in �Body Power� teach exactly that.  The power of words is called �Power Talk�.  Teaching a child something as simple as vocabulary control can make a big improvement in mood and perspective.  �Super Hand Power� helps children recall and bring back good moods by association with a physical movement.  �Super Vision� teaches children to make changes by using positive mental imagery.  Finally, �Super Questions� teaches children to change their focus and concentrate their thoughts on healing answers.<BR>

<P>During each Super Power visit, an EP robot meets with children in small groups and also makes �house calls� to individual patient rooms.  Children receive Super Power Tour stickers and a comic book detailing all the powers to share with their parents and friends. <BR>

<P><BR>



<A NAME="GetOne"></A>

<H3>How can I bring a robot to my facility?</H3>

GoWell & Kent Inc. donates robot visits to children�s facilities whenever possible.  We also thank the many private, corporate, hospital and foundation partners who have joined us in giving this experience to special children nationwide.  Program operating costs are about $1,500 per facility, including printed materials.  To sponsor a program, or to get free program information and funding ideas, please contact us below.<BR>

<A HREF="corp_lst.htm"><H2>Corporate Clients</H2></A>

To some marketing folks, the word "robot" evokes images of something that looks like a plastic trash can and beeps.  We selected these multi-million dollar campaign examples to show how three major companies used robots to get serious PR and marketing results:



<P>

<UL>

<A HREF="ex1_tcro.htm"><H3>Targeting Consumers with Robotic Outreach</H3></A> <!--link ex1_tcro.htm below-->

This company used custom robots to dramatically improve local and national customer relations in 19 states, as well as their national industry perception.  Their program produced terrific results, including millions of dollars worth of positive media coverage and Presidential recognition.



<P>

<A HREF="ex2_isrt.htm"><H3>Insuring Success with Robot Teachers</H3></A> <!--link ex2_isrt.htm below-->

Teaching kids to stay healthy can be pretty dull  . . . unless the teacher�s a robot! This insurance company uses robotic outreach to build consumer relationships and visibility in their market areas. The program�s growth in each of the 8 previous years is just one indication of its effectiveness.



<P>

<A HREF="ex3_rd.htm"><H3>Robo Doc - One Hospital�s Outreach Program</H3></A> <!--link ex3_rd.htm below-->

It would be hard to find a more lovable (or more visible) community ambassador than an EP robot. This hospital conducted a small Educational Outreach Marketing campaign and produced big results.

<P>In addition, modelling work is carried out for individual clients in special
projects. The company specialises in the analysis of long-term change in
economic structure, which is important for strategic planning in business and
government.</P>
<H2>The Company</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics was established in 1978 to provide commercial access
to research in the University of Cambridge, in particular to the work carried
out in developing the `Cambridge Model', the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
British Economy (MDM). The company has always been supported by the commercial
success of its economic forecasting and analysis services. In 1985 there was a
management buy-out in which Cambridge Econometrics became a privately-owned
company. It subsequently took over responsibility for MDM, which represents a
distinctive and independent alternative to the offical models.</P>
<P>Since its founding, Cambridge Econometrics has provided one of the detailed
industrial forecasting services available for the UK economy. The work of the
company has now exapanded to cover regional forecasts for the UK, and industrial
and regional forecasts for the EU, as well as modelling work for individual
clients. Our subscribers include a wide variety of businesses, and also central
and regional government bodies.</P>
<H2>The Services</H2>
<P>Our work for business and government is based on our subscription services,
which combine meetings, reports and an annual conferance, and in the case of the
full services tailored applications of our models. The services provide a
continuing and reliable framework for our forecasting and analysis, so that
companies can use the CE forecasts as a regular input to their own product and
service planning. The annual conferences offer economic analysis of subjects of
current interest that are expected to be important for medium and long-term
strategic assessment. Examples include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Energy, the Environment and Economic Policy (1991)</LI>
<LI>Transport, Communications and the Economy (1992)</LI>
<LI>Structural Change in the Service Industries (1993)</LI>
<LI>Full Employment in Europe (1994)</LI>
<LI>Investment, Profits and Growth (1995)</LI>
<LI>Beyond the Manifestoes - policies and the economy after election (1996)</LI>
<LI>Moving On - transport, location and economic growth after the election
(1997)</LI></UL>
<H2>The Reports</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics publishes its forecasts in regular reports that
`integrate text and charts in an attractive jargon-free presentation' (<I>UK
Economic Forecasts: a Comparative Study</I>, Doug Scott, Headland Press). The
first part of each report usually provides a summary and goes on to cover
economic policy and macroeconomic background. The second part contains analysis,
industry-by-industry or region-by-region, of current trends and forecast
results.</P>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>There are also special scenarios to examine the sensitivity of the results
to alternative assumptions, for example on the development of economic policy or
events in the world economy. The scenario assumptions, like the forecast
assumptions, are developed in consultation with subscribers. Full results of the
forecasts and scenarios are given in tables and charts, with some of these
providing key summaries for quick reference.</P>
<H2>Economists</H2>
<P>When producing our forecasts we have access not only to our staff, with
their industrial and regional expertise, but also to specialised consultants in
the University of Cambridge and other institutions, and to business economists
in industry. Our own senior staff include:</P>

<P>In addition, modelling work is carried out for individual clients in special
projects. The company specialises in the analysis of long-term change in
economic structure, which is important for strategic planning in business and
government.</P>
<H2>The Company</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics was established in 1978 to provide commercial access
to research in the University of Cambridge, in particular to the work carried
out in developing the `Cambridge Model', the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
British Economy (MDM). The company has always been supported by the commercial
success of its economic forecasting and analysis services. In 1985 there was a
management buy-out in which Cambridge Econometrics became a privately-owned
company. It subsequently took over responsibility for MDM, which represents a
distinctive and independent alternative to the offical models.</P>
<P>Since its founding, Cambridge Econometrics has provided one of the detailed
industrial forecasting services available for the UK economy. The work of the
company has now exapanded to cover regional forecasts for the UK, and industrial
and regional forecasts for the EU, as well as modelling work for individual
clients. Our subscribers include a wide variety of businesses, and also central
and regional government bodies.</P>
<H2>The Services</H2>
<P>Our work for business and government is based on our subscription services,
which combine meetings, reports and an annual conferance, and in the case of the
full services tailored applications of our models. The services provide a
continuing and reliable framework for our forecasting and analysis, so that
companies can use the CE forecasts as a regular input to their own product and
service planning. The annual conferences offer economic analysis of subjects of
current interest that are expected to be important for medium and long-term
strategic assessment. Examples include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Energy, the Environment and Economic Policy (1991)</LI>
<LI>Transport, Communications and the Economy (1992)</LI>
<LI>Structural Change in the Service Industries (1993)</LI>
<LI>Full Employment in Europe (1994)</LI>
<LI>Investment, Profits and Growth (1995)</LI>
<LI>Beyond the Manifestoes - policies and the economy after election (1996)</LI>
<LI>Moving On - transport, location and economic growth after the election
(1997)</LI></UL>
<H2>The Reports</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics publishes its forecasts in regular reports that
`integrate text and charts in an attractive jargon-free presentation' (<I>UK
Economic Forecasts: a Comparative Study</I>, Doug Scott, Headland Press). The
first part of each report usually provides a summary and goes on to cover
economic policy and macroeconomic background. The second part contains analysis,
industry-by-industry or region-by-region, of current trends and forecast
results.</P>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>There are also special scenarios to examine the sensitivity of the results
to alternative assumptions, for example on the development of economic policy or
events in the world economy. The scenario assumptions, like the forecast
assumptions, are developed in consultation with subscribers. Full results of the
forecasts and scenarios are given in tables and charts, with some of these
providing key summaries for quick reference.</P>
<H2>Economists</H2>
<P>When producing our forecasts we have access not only to our staff, with
their industrial and regional expertise, but also to specialised consultants in
the University of Cambridge and other institutions, and to business economists
in industry. Our own senior staff include:</P>

<H2>Start-up Meeting for Completion/Extension Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>Following the A1 grading given to the proposal to complete and extend the
E3ME model by the Commission's independent evaluation committee, a start-up
meeting was held on 27-28th February 1996 in Brussels to discuss the various
areas of work.  The project is divided into seven identifiable workpackages
which are briefly described below:</P>
<H4>Workpackage 1: Completion of the `core' model</H4>
<P>This workpackage is sub-divided into three groups</P>
<UL>
<LI>Collection of data</LI>
<LI>Validation of equation parameters</LI>
<LI>Validation of base-line scenario</LI></UL>
<P>It is envisaged that this workpackage will be completed by the end of
September 1996.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 2: Extension to the new EU Member States, Norway and
Switzerland</H4>
<P>The enlargement of the EU at the start of 1995 justifies the inclusion of
the new Member States in E3ME.  This work will follow the three tasks identified
in workpackage 1.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 3: Completion of energy/environment systems</H4>
<P>It is intended that energy and emissions in E3ME be modelled using an
approach which is based more on energy and emission abatement technologies. 
This work area also includes revisiting the relationships between energy,
environment and economy.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 4: Developments and innovations in economic modelling</H4>
<P>Research will be undertaken on the supply-side of the model focusing on
output.  The introduction of forward-looking variables and solutions in E3ME is
envisaged.  Research will seek out ways of introducing limited rational
expectations behaviour in key areas of the model.  Other areas of research will
focus on completion of the international sector of E3ME, in particular the trade
equations.  The investment equations are to be extended to cover investment by
asset and new equations estimated.  The consumption equations are to be updated
with an allocation structure for private consumption by use of a more
disaggregated energy module.  Input-output coefficients are to be analysed with
the aim of endogenising the currently fixed set of coefficients in E3ME.  The
economic/institutional treatment in E3ME is to be completed with re-estimation
of economic relationships taking place.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 5: Base scenarios (by region)</H4>
<P>This workpackage involves the validation of assumptions and an assessment of
the short-term growth rates in output.  This workpackage also involves a base
case projection with validation.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 6: One-region solution</H4>
<P>The Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Paris are involved in the
application of E3ME to the French economy, thus enabling the model to solve for
one region alone.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 7: User-friendly software</H4>
<P>The objective is to make E3ME easier to use.  Cambridge Econometrics is
currently investigating alternative software packages for processing of
assumptions and presentation of results.</P>

<P>It is intended to update the existing version of the model with new data,
parameters and a model solution (E3ME12) by the end of September 1996.  The
extension of the new member states, and incorporation of developments and
innovations in economic modelling is expected by the end of 1997, by which time
a new model solution (E3ME21) will be made available.</P>

<H2>Results from Model Simulations</H2></CENTER>
<P>A recent paper by Terry Barker and Ben Gardiner entitled `The Direct Effects
of Energy-Saving R&amp;D on International Competitiveness and Employment in the
European Union', makes use of the E3ME model.  A 10% increase in total business
R&amp;D across the EU was allocated across industries in proportion to their
energy costs.  The increase in energy-saving R&amp;D expenditure was assumed to
be financed by a reallocation of the public sector expenditure on military R&amp;D,
so that there was no change in total R&amp;D spending.  This financing was
assumed to determine the allocation across member states, so that France and the
UK, with the largest military R&amp;D budgets, would also have the largest
increases in energy-saving R&amp;D. The paper describes in detail the components
of such a policy exercise: the effect that R&amp;D in general might be expected

budgets and the design of the scenarios to reallocate these budgets; and results
from the model solution showing the <I>direct</I> effect on employment and
competitiveness (both domestic and internationally) that the R&amp;D policy will
have.  The paper concludes that significant and permanent reductions in energy
demand and improvements in international competitiveness are likely if R&amp;D
budgets are switched towards energy-saving by industrial enterprises.  The
effects on employment are mixed, but overall employment is expected to be
higher.</P>
<P>The results for the EU11 are summarised in Table 2.  This shows percentage
differences from base solutions for 9 variables in E3ME for the years 2000, 2005
and 2010.  These are the <I>direct effects</I> of the extra R&amp;D.  A full
model solution would include further interaction effects, which could be twice
are large as those reported.</P>

<H4>Telecommunications Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Impact on employment of liberalisation/privatisation in the
Telecommunications sector.</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>V/CO24/94</B></P>
<P>The data and equations of E3ME are used in the project is to run a variety
of simulations to the year 2005.  The simulations look at various aspects of the
telecoms liberalisation process and their effects on industry prices,
competitiveness, and ultimately employment creation/destruction.</P>
<H4>The Internal Market and Employment Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>The effect of the intra-EU trade on manufacturing employment
and labour costs due to the Internal Market programme.</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>XV/95/42/A
</B></P>
<P>This project uses the E3ME model to analyse the effects of the Internal
Market programme (IMP) on the EU labour market.  Two interim reports and a final
report has been submitted thus far.  For the final report the baseline and
antimonde simulations were developed with research focusing on possible changes
to the modelling structure in the light of a literature review on
trade-employment linkages.  The changes mainly involve the labour-market
equations but other areas, eg trade-investment causality, were also
investigated.</P>
<H4>Fiscal Instruments Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Potential impact on employment creation of fiscal instruments
(namely of a reduced VAT rate for selected sectors).</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>XXI/96/CB-3001</B></P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics was awarded a contract to analyse the potential
effects of the fiscal instrumentation on employment creation.  A final report
has been submitted.  The study uses the E3ME model to establish a counterfactual
scenario, ie if the changes in taxation had not occurred, and compare this with
baseline model simulation results for employment in the UK, Italy, Belgium,
Spain and Germany.</P>
<H4>ERECO Projections</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Europe in 2001, Economic Analyses and Forecasts</B></P>
<P>The E3ME model was used to provide an initial sectoral forecast to 2001. 
The baseline was guided by a macroeconomic growth pattern for the components of
GDP to ensure a consistency between the meso and macro levels.</P>
<H4>Environmental Fiscal Reform</H4>
<P>This project is concerned with the equity aspects of substantial
environmental fiscal reform.  Five aspects are to be considered: first, the
income distribution of household expenditure on environmentally-sensitive goods
and services, such as electricity consumption, spending on petrol; second, the
effect of any extra employment and reductions in unemployment on the incomes of
the low-paid and of low-income households; third, the income distribution of
those who suffer damage from environmental costs; fourth, the effects of reform
on vulnerable demographic groups, such as the retired population; and fifth the
effects on rural versus urban households.  E3ME is to be used as a framework for
the statistics being collected and used by the project.</P>
<P>The project is being co-ordinated by the Department of Applied Economics,
University of Cambridge (Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DE, UK, tel +44 1223
335289, fax +44 1223 335299).  The set-up meeting of the project took place in
late January.</P>

<P></P>
<P>This is the first of a regular biannual series of Newsletters for LEFM
users.  Its aim is to keep users abreast of current issues, providing support
for their work and updating them on developments in the LEFM software.  The
editors would be pleased to receive comments on this first issue and suggestions
for subsequent issues (write or Email the Editors of the Newsletter, Saxon
Brettell and Rob Wilson at the addresses below).   The Newsletter is published
in both electronic and paper versions.</P>
<H2>Version 2.1 of LEFM Released</H2>
<P>Version 2.1 of <I>Local Economy Forecasting Model</I> has been released,
and all users updating to the March round of CE/IER forecasts are receiving this
new version as standard.  The latest version incorporates additional features,
reflecting suggestions from LEFM users, that are designed to make the model more
versatile.  Version 2.1 includes flexible tabulations and further options
regarding occupation assumptions.  In addition to the locally based assumptions
that already existed in LEFM, the user can now impose national or regional
trends in occupation change upon their local areas.</P>
<H2>Have you been SIC92'ed?</H2>
<P>LEFM updates from March will also include data from the 1993 Census of
Employment, the first data set at a local level released on the basis of the
SIC92 classification.  This is a major reclassification from SIC80.  Some
problems were initially evident in the data released by NOMIS with some
inconsistencies in the areas and these data were withdrawn and re-released. 
Also the 1991 dual-classified data essential for understanding the effect of the
changes at local level have only just been released, and very interesting they
are too....
</P>
<P>Users of these data will know that the SIC92 revision has required a major
reclassification of employment by the Office of National Statistics (ONS has
been formed from the merger of OPCS and CSO), with overnight some 10% of UK
manufacturing employment being reclassified into business services.  Local
analysts will need to look carefully at the changes in their own local data sets
and in principle this is best done with the 1991 data since it is dual coded,
although 1993 is a fuller data set.  Census of Employment time series are the
major guide to economic restructuring at the local level so that this break in
the series will be a major concern to local practitioners.  The good news is
that in future these data will be available annually from ONS, with less than a
year's delay (although based on a sample rather than a full census).  CE/IER
have assessed the dual-classified information just released for 1991 and have
established a linkage procedure for constructing consistent series for 1981-93. 
Local authorities will have the advantage of access to detailed information on
the reclassification of their local firms and we are happy to work with local
agencies with LEFM if they want to undertake a more thorough analysis of their
local data sets so as to establish an agreed consistent data series at their
local level - more on these items and other data changes at the....</P>
<H2>LEFM Annual Conference 6/7 June</H2>
<P>This conference is now an established annual event for LEFM users.  We
intend it to be the major opportunity for LEFM users with different experiences
to meet, exchange information and discuss practical issues with other users and
CE/IER providers - so put the date in your diaries now!  Further details on the
conference and a booking form are enclosed with the hard copy version of this
newsletter.  For additional information and to book your place, contact Barbara
Wilson at IER.</P>
<P>As the number of LEFM users is rapidly expanding across the UK, this is set
to become a major conference for local economy practitioners and we wish to
reflect this in the content of the conference.  As last year, it will be a
two-day event held on <B>Thursday June 6-Friday June 7 1996</B>. It takes
place, also as last year, in the Scarman House conference centre located in the
grounds of the University of Warwick.  This gives state-of-the-art facilities
for conferencing, excellent guest accommodation and catering, all in a splendid
environmental setting - just the forum for a series of stimulating presentations
this year.</P>
<P>In addition to contributions from CE and IER, there will be a number of
external speakers at this year's event.  To complement the formal sessions on
important new LEFM developments and advice on how to get the most out of new
data available at local level, a broad theme for this year will be to cover the
issues of partnership building, and developing local economic strategies.  This
reflects our awareness that many users are seeing the role of their
organisations both deepen and broaden.  As a consequence, they are frequently
being asked to provide economic context and support for locally-based
initiatives involving partnerships (often in groups involving local authorities,
TEC/LECs, Chambers, Government Offices and Business Links).  Such partnership
building has been important in attracting inward investment.  Users also face
increasing calls for evaluation of their own agency's work and its impact on
local economic activity.  LEFM can provide a suitable framework for such an
evaluation.  The speakers will review the issues involved, and draw lessons from
a number of recent projects involving impact analysis and policy evaluation for
local partners.</P>
<P>There will also be plenty of formal and informal opportunities to talk to
speakers, designers and other LEFM users, and to gain or improve hands-on
experience using the LEFM software.  There will be LEFM practical sessions for
novices and for more experienced practitioners, and opportunities to receive
one-to-one based advice from our expert team. Indeed there will be time to
interrogate software designers, if necessary continuing late into the night in
the conference bar!  Between sessions and in the morning and evening, as our
participants discovered last year, one can also take advantage of the
University's splendid facilities for sport, with extensive walks available in
the beautiful environment of the grounds, especially useful for laptop users.</P>
<H2>Developments of Enhanced LEFM Software</H2>
<P><B>EVALEFM</B> - a local-economy-forecasting-impact-evaluation model, with
enhanced facilities for evaluating the impact of European investment spending,
has been developed and implemented for Merseyside and Strathclyde local areas
</P>
<P><B>EULEFM </B>- a local economy forecasting model for Europe is under
development.  A German language version of LEFM has been developed for use in
the new L&auml;nder of Germany in cooperation with Ecometrika GMbH in Berlin. 
This is designed to work with the E3ME model developed by a team led by
Cambridge Econometrics for Europe in the same way that LEFM works with CE's MDM
national-regional model in the UK.  The E3ME model was developed under the
European Commission's Joule II R&amp;D programme, and distinguishes some 32
industry sectors.  The E3ME project began in 1993 with the aim of developing a
single regionalised model of Europe designed to evaluate policies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by some 60% over the next 50 years.  A proposal to
enhance the model and extend it to cover new Member States has been accepted
under the Joule III Programme, and this will form the starting point for the
next phase of research.</P>
<H2>Recent Applications</H2>
<P>Among significant recent model developments for LEFM has been work enhancing
the simulation facilities in LEFM.  This has been used to evaluate the impact of
EU and UK government support for local areas.  Work for the Brent Regeneration
Agency, the Stockport Partnership, and the regional partners in Merseyside and
Strathclyde region, has led to enhanced treatment of the supply-side of the
model.</P>
<H3>Merseyside Economic Assessment</H3>
<P>Merseyside has been granted EU Structural Funds status under the Objective 1
category. The Monitoring Committee of the regional partners has overall
responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the agreed Single
Programming Document (SPD) for Merseyside, designed to facilitate convergence of
Merseyside towards average European income levels over 1994-99.  Work on the SPD
was originally undertaken in 1994 by CE and IER.  They used version 1.01 LEFM
software model to help set quantitative `baseline' targets for EU support on
infrastructure and human resources.  These targets were subsequently embodied in
`Merseyside 2000', the EU-approved SPD providing the basis for implementation of
the detailed programme.  This work was followed up in 1995 with a second project
giving an interim assessment of the programme after two years and reviewing the
guidance on approvals.  This follow-up work was undertaken for the Labour Market
Strategy Group (representing Merseyside Government Office, local TECs, local
authorities and others) in close association with KPMG's Liverpool office.  It
used an enhanced version 2.01 EVALEFM model to provide an up-to-date
counterfactual scenario, (ie an assessment of what the local economy might have
achieved if the Objective 1 programme had not occurred) and compared this with a
baseline forecast simulation.  A number of variant future development scenarios
were simulated reflecting enhanced support for `clusters' of export-oriented
sectors in the local area.  The EVALEFM model was thereby used to underpin
effective labour market policy advice.  The work informed the dissemination of
guidance for applicants for funds in 1996, and supported the information
requirements of local economic development agencies.  The outcome - Merseyside
Economic Assessment - established a consensus approach for the many
participating agencies, allowing them to support the recommended new initiatives
to achieve the programme objectives.  LEFM was seen by the partners as a
fundamental tool for achieving a consensus among the partner organisations,
since it provided a clear framework for considering the development
alternatives.</P>
<H3>East Midlands Economic Review</H3>
<P>Version 2.0 multi-area LEFM software provided the framework for an economic
assessment of the East Midlands economy for a research group comprising the
Government Office for the East Midlands and the seven independent agencies (TECs
and recently merged TECs and Chambers) concerned with local training, enterprise
and development.  The study, undertaken by CE and York Consulting, established
an overall economic appraisal for the region and the seven local TEC areas in
close consultation with the East Midlands research group.  The work was guided
by a forward-looking study utilising a LEFM for each of the seven areas,
consistent with the latest CE forecast for the East Midlands region.  The study
identified the sources of economic growth and restructuring effects at a
detailed industry level, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats to the component local economies of the region in a context of the
global competition faced by the UK economy. The outcome was a comprehensive
report suitable as a reference document for the agencies and for use in Single
Regeneration Budget (SRB) and other forms of funding bids, and the provision of
TEC-level LEFM software embodying the detailed forecasts from the study.</P>
<H3>Toyota Impact</H3>
<P>Analysis of historical behaviour and trends is not always a good guide to
future events. Major discontinuities can arise as a result of closures of large
organisation or substantial inward investment. The LEFM package is designed to
allow users to address such issues explicitly using an impact module.</P>
<P>This has been used to assess the impact of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the
Toyota investment in Burnaston in Derbyshire. The former is a retrospective
analysis of what the effects of Phase 1 have been, while the analysis of Phase 2
is prospective. In both cases the LEFM software enables an analysis of both
direct and indirect effects of the investment on the local economy.</P>
<P>The results illustrate the substantial effect that the Toyota investment has
had on the local area. In total, some 6,000 jobs will have probably been created
in the south Derbyshire area by the end of Phase 2, of which about a third are
indirect. The package also enables an assessment of the sensitivity of these
conclusions to a range of alternative assumptions. Further details on how to use
the impact module of LEFM are available on request.</P>
<H3>Partnerships between TECs and Local Authorities</H3>
<P>Partnerships between TECs, Councils and other bodies are very much the
vogue.  Some have been going strong for a number of years.  A good case in point
is the partnership between Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council and
Leicestershire County Council. They have been working together in producing a
Labour Market Assessment for Leicestershire for the last four years.</P>
<P>Their most recent publication <B>Leicestershire Economic Assessment, March
1996</B> published jointly by the TEC and Council, is based on the use of LEFM. 
LEFM has provided a framework which the partners have used to work together and
develop their own view of local economic and labour market prospects.  This has
included linking the LEFM results with detailed demographic modelling and
forecasting work undertaken by the Council including numerous sector studies.</P>
<P>Details of these publications are available from Leicestershire TEC.  Call
0116 265 1515 for further information.</P>
<H3>Educational Reforms and Reorganisation: Use of LEFM in Careers Advice</H3>
<P>The dramatic changes under way in the further and higher educational system
and related organisations have highlighted the need for information about
employment and careers prospects.  Educational establishments are now charged
with ensuring that their courses have relevance to the local and national
economies.</P>
<P>The reorganisation of the way in which careers advice is delivered has also
focused the attention of some careers advisors on how they can make the best use
of the available information to provide the most useful advice to their clients.
 Sussex Careers Services Ltd (previously East Sussex Careers Service) is at the
forefront of such developments and has found LEFM a useful item in its tool-kit.</P>
<P>The present version of LEFM does not analyse qualifications held by the
workforce explicitly. However, CE/IER are currently considering whether such an
addition to the package would be a valuable enhancement.  Readers' thoughts on
this issue are welcomed.  Please contact Saxon Brettell or Rob Wilson on the
phone numbers or Email addresses given at the end of this newsletter.</P>
<H2>Description of the Local Economy Forecasting Model</H2>
<P>LEFM is a general economic forecasting model for local areas capable of
addressing issues that link development and policy.  The essential purpose of
the model is to provide a forward- looking framework to inform analysts and
decision-makers at the local level about the key economic features of their
locality, including the main behavioural and technical links between the economy
and the labour market.</P>

<H1>UK ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT FORECASTING SERVICE</H1></CENTER>
<P>Subscribers to CE's UK Industrial Service are able to benefit from an add-on
service providing energy and environment forecasts consistent with the economic
forecasts.</P>
<H2>What makes the Cambridge Econometrics service different?</H2>
<P>There are many energy analysts and economic forecasters producing forecasts
of oil prices or electricity sales, but these tend to be produced in isolation,
or with limited links to related economic factors.</P>
<P>By contrast, the Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy
(MDM) produces one of the most detailed sets of forecasts available, including
consumer demand for 68 commodities, and forecasts of output by 50 industries on
a bottom-up basis.</P>
<P>An energy sub-model is integrated within the main model.  Inputs, such as
prices and levels of economic activity, feed into the sub-model from the main
model.  A set of energy demand equations, for total energy and  by fuel type, is
used to determine final demand for 10 fuels by 12 different user groups.  In
addition, a separate capacity-based sub-model of the electricity supply industry
calculates fuel use by power generation, and there is a technology-based
sub-model of domestic energy demand.</P>
<P>The forecast fuel demands feed back into the main model to give expenditure
on fuels by industry, consumers and government.</P>
<P>Emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and SO<SUB>2</SUB> (and, in due course, a
range of other environmental emissions) are calculated from the forecast fuel
use.</P>
<H2>The Service</H2>
<P>The service provides a report published twice a year as a supplement to <I>Industry
and the British Economy</I>, and forecasts are available on diskette.</P>
<P>The reports summarise the key energy/environment assumptions and include the
following forecast tables to 2010:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fuel Demand by Fuel Type, original units</LI></UL>
<P>For each fuel type, fuel use by user is shown - see the attached sample
table.  Enables identification of market for each fuel type, eg Demand for Coal
by Power Generation, Chemicals industry</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fuel Demand by Fuel User, mtoe</LI></UL>
<P>For each fuel user, fuel use by type is shown.  Enables identification of
market shares, eg Power Generation demand for Coal, Gas, Fuel Oil</P>
<UL>
<LI>Growth in Prices of Main Fuels to each User Group</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Carbon Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Sulphur Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User</LI></UL>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>Subscribers are also able to commission their own scenarios against
individual quotations.  If you subscribe to the Full Industrial Service, you can
use your two scenarios to explore energy and environment linkages with the UK
economy.  The Cambridge model is particularly well suited to testing for example
the effect of environmental tax reform on energy use, carbon emissions, sulphur
emissions, and the macroeconomy, and is able to capture the effects of such tax
reform at the level of each industry in a manner consistent with activity
throughout the whole economy.</P>

<H1>UK CONSTRUCTION PROSPECTS</H1></CENTER>
<P>This new report examines the construction industry's prospects in the short
and long term. The detailed forecasts and analysis address the following issues,
of key interest to everyone involved in the construction industry and related
sectors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The benefits to the construction industry of service-led growth</LI>
<LI>The construction industry after the General Election</LI>
<LI>Strong and weak construction markets in the short and long term</LI>
<LI>The factors driving long-term growth to 2003</LI>
<LI>The impact of a shift towards environmentally sustainable growth</LI></UL>
<P>The approach focuses on the prospects for investment spending by sector (eg
retailing, finance and business services), the key determinant of construction
demand. The prospects for the construction industry are therefore set in the
context of the economy generally, and investment spending in particular.</P>
<P>A special supplement focuses on the impact on the aggregates industries of a
shift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability, and suggests
strategies to respond to this shift. Specific policies examined include the
introduction of the landfill tax and the slowdown in roadbuilding. The author of
the supplement is Paul Ekins, Senior Lecturer in Environmental Policy at Keele
University, director of Forum for the Future and a senior consultant at
Cambridge Econometrics</P>
<P>Detailed forecasts and analysis are provided for the 10 types of work - 6
new work and 4 repair &amp; maintenance - as published by the DoE in its
construction industry statistics. Detailed forecasts are also provided for the
38 categories of investment in buildings and works as published in the UK
National Accounts.</P>
<P>The short-term outlook (1996, 1997 and 1998) is separated from a longer-term
outlook (1998-2003). Charts and tables convey the information in an
easy-to-comprehend format.</P>

<P>Cambridge Econometrics' industrial service is designed to meet the needs of
business and government for medium and long term structural forecasting and
analysis of the UK economy.  The service is organised around subscriber meetings
and two forecast reports a year, in January and June.  The forecasts take into
account the latest  available data from official statistics and government
policy statements.</P>
<H2>Subscriber Meetings</H2>
<P>A central feature of the service is the involvement of subscribers in
preparing the assumptions and in  discussing the results of the forecasts.  In
October, tables of assumptions together with supporting text are communicated to
subscribers giving them the opportunity to comment and state their views. These
are taken into account when assumptions are finalised. The service includes two
meetings a year, shortly after publication of the January and June forecasts to
present and discuss the analysis and outcomes.  Our forecast presentations in
January and June are accompanied by guest speakers addressing topical issues. 
Recent speakers have included Kate Barker (Chief Economic Adviser, CBI), John
Stewart (Managing Editor, Housing Market Report) and Mike Hollingsworth (Chief
Economist, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) and Vicky Pryce (Partner
and Chief Economist, KPMG).</P>
<P>In addition the service includes an annual two-day residential conference to
explore in greater depth topics important to long-term economic development. 
The 1996 conference was <I>Beyond the Manifestoes,</I> and it was held at
Robinson College, Cambridge on 8-9 July 1996.  The speakers included MPs from
the three main political parties (Angela Knight, Conservative; Andrew Smith,
Labour; Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat), John Mitchell of the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, Prof Phil Goodwin of the University College London,
Prof Jim Taylor of the University of Lancaster and Andrew Britton of the
Churches Enquiry into Unemployment and the Future of Work.</P>
<H2>The Reports</H2>
<P>The structure of the reports, and the selection of tables and the economic
variables analysed, have evolved to match the requirements of subscribers.  Each
industrial report is divided into three parts.</P>
<UL>
<LI>the forecast overview with chapters on the world economy, UK economic
policy, the industrial forecast and the macroeconomic background</LI>
<LI>industry in detail, with text, charts and tables to analyse and interpret
in comprehensive detail the prospects for the 49 industries distinguished in the
report</LI>
<LI>the main tables giving the macroeconomic summary, coverage of prospects at
the detail published in the official Index of Production, with comparable detail
for the service industries, and finally levels and growth rates for a wide range
of economic variables.</LI></UL>
<P>The forecasts are available on diskettes for easy use by subscribers in
their own databases.</P>
<P>The reports also contain special features of topical interest.  In recent
issues, these have included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Effects of the EC's Carbon/Energy Tax on the UK Economy</LI>
<LI>Inward Investment</LI>
<LI>Prospects for the UK Housing Market</LI>
<LI>Disaggregated Analysis of UK Exports by Country and Sector</LI>
<LI>Changes and Pressures in the Service Sector</LI>
<LI>Property in a Low-Inflation Era</LI></UL>
<H2>The Model We Use</H2>
<P>The projections are based on MDM, a very large model with some 5,000
variables. It is distinguished from most other UK models by its degree of
`disaggregation'  - the extent to which it breaks the economy down into
different sectors - and by the fact that it is estimated on annual rather than
quarterly data.</P>
<P>Other models do incorporate some disaggregation (or are accompanied by an
industrial model as an add-on extra), perhaps as a matter of convenience in the
context of a basically aggregate or `macro' approach to model-building, and in
such models events at sectoral level cannot be taken formally into account.  In
MDM, on the other hand, the 49 industries are distinguished as integral parts of
a single large model.  The number of industries is chosen to give a good balance
across the economy, without encumbering the model and the forecast with
irrelevant and unnecessary detail.  Because the model solves `bottom-up' by
adding industry projections together, it does not suffer from the discrepancies
between industry totals and macro totals that appear in a two-model approach. 
It produces consistent macroeconomic, industrial and financial forecasts, which
are provided together, in one service.</P>
<P>As an annual model, estimated on time-series data going back to the early
1960s or earlier (1954 for some series), MDM is particularly well-suited for
medium and long-term forecasting.  The data are continually updated from
official sources using the 1990 price base and the 1992 SIC.</P>
<P>Our projections include:</P>

<P><I>The Economic Journal</I>, December 1988</P>
<H2>Forecasting Structural Change</H2>
<P>MDM is essentially a model of economic <I>structure</I>, which is important
for an economy undergoing long-term structural change due to such factors as 
the rise and decline of North Sea oil, rapid technological development, and
major changes in economic policy. Conventional aggregate macroeconomic models
rely on economic relationships remaining stable through time, but these are more
likely to break down when the composition of the economy is changing.</P>
<H2>Applications</H2>
<P>The detail incorporated in MDM means that it can be used to examine the
prospects for particular industries and their interactions with the rest of the
economy in a way that more aggregate econometric models cannot.</P>
<P>This applicability of MDM means that our reports can be tailored to the
requirements of individual clients, and that the aspects most relevant to their
needs can be selected.  Work of this kind is carried out on a consultancy basis
and falls into the following categories:</P>
<H4>Complete Forecasts</H4>
<P>Preparation of a complete forecast based on assumptions specified by a
client.  In this working relationship, we use the client's own corporate view of
government policy and the world economy to obtain projections using MDM.</P>
<H4>Scenarios</H4>
<P>It may be valuable to consider a range of alternative assumptions concerning
an indicator, for example a variety of exchange rates around a central
projection.  To meet this kind of need, simulations are carried out, varying
particular assumptions and examining the resulting differences from the central
projection.  The critical assumptions to be varied are first agreed with the
client.</P>
<H4>New Models</H4>
<P>We can create new econometric models for specific needs.  Work of this sort
has included in the past the preparation of sub-regional models for local
authorities and models linking a company's sales to MDM indicators.</P>
<H4>Market Prospects</H4>
<P>Provision of forecasts and assessments for a particular sector or
sub-region.  Such reports provide data and predictions at a very detailed level.</P>
<H4>Briefings and Seminars</H4>
<P>Held either in Cambridge or on clients' own premises, to present and discuss
the reports and services provided.</P>

<H2>Local economic analysis - the need</H2>
<P>Many policy advisors and business planners require economic information and
analysis at a local level, rather than at a regional or national level. In a
single European market, what happens in the local economy is increasingly
subject to national and international trends, but the way in which each local
area responds to these trends depends on its particular features. Whether
developing a strategy for a local area, evaluating the impact of regional
policy, or assessing the prospects for future growth in incomes and employment,
analysts need to combine an understanding of global trends with knowledge of the
local area.</P>
<P>But economic analysis at the local level has often not met the users' needs
adequately.</P>
<P>There is a need to draw on national and regional data to supplement limited
local information. This uses substantial resources, and may be carried out in an
<I>ad hoc</I> way that is difficult to reproduce later.</P>
<P>The scale of the task may require the use of external consultants. This can
leave in-house staff without the knowledge needed to interpret or update the
analysis.</P>
<P>The link between developments in the national and international economy and
the local areas is seldom made formal. But the result can be that these trends
are not quantified and so their significance is impossible to gauge.</P>
<P>There is no tool to develop scenarios of what might happen under different
assumptions. But evaluation requires an assessment of what would have happened
if the policy has not been implemented.</P>
<H2>LEFM - a tool for local economic analysis and projections</H2>
<P>LEFM is a friendly PC-based tool for local economic analysis and
projections. It draws on Cambridge Econometrics' expertise in macroeconomic,
sectoral and regional analysis across Europe. Users receive a tailored version
of LEFM, with a base forecast calibrated to local conditions, but they can also
develop their own scenarios. Comparison with national projections is made
available, in order to put the local results in context.</P>
<P><B>LEFM provides</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>an efficient means of generating local projections</LI>
<LI>easy updating, allowing the user to  draw on and reassess previous analysis</LI>
<LI>sectoral detail, so that projections can be identified with major local
enterprises</LI>
<LI>a systematic, rigorous and transparent method, so that results can easily
be traced back to assumptions</LI>
<LI>easy links to regularly updated, authoritative forecasts at the European
and national level</LI>
<LI>a tool for constructing scenarios, examining the local impact of inward
investment, plant closures, and regional policy</LI></UL>

<TITLE>Regional Housing Market Prospects</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Housing Market Activity to Pick Up in All Regions, Followed
by Stronger House Price Inflation</H1>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its first edition of <I>Regional
Housing Market Prospects</I>, containing detailed housing market forecasts to
the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These forecasts are
based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and on
its regional housing submodel.</P>
<P>The number of housing transactions in England &amp; Wales is forecast to
rise by 4.8% in 1996, following the decline of over 10% during 1995.  This
increase in housing market activity combined with a steadily growing economy,
rising employment and falling unemployment is expected to boost house prices by
an average of 2% in the UK in 1996.</P>
<P>However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase in
activity expected in East Anglia, the East Midlands and Wales, and the largest
house price rises in London, East Anglia and Northern Ireland.</P>
<H3>Activity to Rise in all Regions</H3>
<P>Following a year of large declines in housing turnover in almost all the
regions, activity is forecast to pick up during this year and next, helped by
low interest rates and stronger growth in disposable incomes. The strong demand
conditions recently experienced in East Anglia and the East Midlands are
expected to continue through the year and housing turnover is forecast to grow
by around 13% in both regions in 1996.</P>
<P>At the other end of the spectrum, activity in the South East housing markets
is forecast to remain the most subdued during the year, continuing to be
hindered by still substantial levels of debt and the slow growth expected in the
region's working-age population.  Activity is expected to grow more slowly in
Greater London than in the rest of the South East, but this still represents a
marked improvement over 1995 when turnover fell by over 13%.</P>
<P>The North and Wales are forecast to see rises in activity of around 9%, as
they recover from below-trend levels of activity.  In Wales this is combined
with a rising working-age population and thus a larger pool of potential market
entrants.  In both regions, housing is now among the most affordable in the UK.</P>
<P>The recovery in market activity is expected to improve during 1997, on the
expectation that general inflation will rise by slightly more than interest
rates.  The increased activity is expected to be concentrated in the southern
part of the UK, where evidence suggests that the markets are more responsive to
real interest rates.</P>
<H3>Regional House Prices to Remain Static at Worst</H3>
<P>No region is likely to see declines in house prices in 1996 although prices
in the North are forecast to remain static, and those in the South West, the
West Midlands and the North West are expected to rise by less than 1%.  Except
for the North West, these regions saw rising house prices during 1995 and high
rates of growth in personal incomes, which are forecast to see a sharp slowdown
during this year.</P>
<P>Northern Ireland and Greater London, despite the slow transactions growth
forecast in the latter, are expected to see the strongest price inflation at
over 5%.  In East Anglia, the strong increase in transactions is expected to
support a 3.8% rise in prices in 1996.  Prices in East Anglia are now likely to
respond more quickly to increased market activity, as the pick-up in activity in
1995 has helped to restore confidence.</P>
<P>Above-average activity in the East Midlands and Wales will support
above-average increases in house prices.</P>
<P>Inflation is expected to accelerate in all regions in 1997, but large
variations will persist among the regions, with East Anglia forecast to be in
the lead.</P>
<H3>Long-Term Prospects in Regional Housing Markets</H3>
<P>The strongest markets over the long term are forecast to be in the regions
expected to see net inward migration: the South West, Wales and East Anglia. 
Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by around 2% pa over
2000-05, while growth of only 1% pa is forecast in England &amp; Wales as a
whole over this period.  Such demand growth will provide a foundation for strong
house price increases, especially as it will be associated with a tighter
housing market.  The rate of growth in incomes and labour market participation
will also be influential, notably in the East Midlands.  Activity in Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside is expected to be held back by a working-age population that shows
little change, but growth in average household incomes and rising economic
participation are expected to push house price inflation to only slightly below
the UK average.</P>
<P>In general, those regions that are forecast to see the strongest
transactions growth in the long term will also experience the fastest rise in
house prices.</P>

<H3>Notes to Editors</H3>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and sectoral forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.
</P>
<P>The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housing
submodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housing
turnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment.</P>
<P><I>Regional Housing Market Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies through subscription
to the company's UK Regional Housing Market Service at &#163;4,950 per annum.</P>

<H1>Europe's Cities Restructure to Face Global Competition</H1></CENTER>
<P>ERECO, the grouping of leading European economic research institutes, today
publishes its annual report <I>European Regional Prospects</I>, containing
forecasts for 39 major cities and over 200 European regions up to the year 2000.</P>
<P>The report identifies trends and strategies across Europe's cities that
reflect the need for each city to improve its `offer' in the face of a wider
field of competition than in the past. These include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>redeveloping old industrial sites</LI>
<LI>improving local and international transport links</LI>
<LI>developing strategic planning authorities</LI></UL>
<P>However, the ability to invest is constrained by tight public finances, and
attempts to set up authorities with a wider remit for strategic planning have
suffered setbacks in the past year.</P>
<H2>Old Industrial Sites Transformed</H2>
<P>As industry moves out, cities are taking advantage of the sites released to
transform them into competitive locations for the high value added services in
which their future lies.  In the west of <I>Paris</I>, a major European
hospital (the Georges Pompidou hospital) is being built on the former Citro&euml;n
site in the 15th arrondissement.  The former industrial area of Boulogne
Billancourt, the 15th arrondissement, and Issy les Moulineaux is fast turning
into a media quarter: TF1 and Canal Plus television are already based there and
France t&eacute;l&eacute;vision may join them in the longer term.  <I>Torino</I>
presents a similar example: the former Fiat city-centre premises of Lingotto are
being transformed into offices, a major exhibition space and a conference
centre.  IBM has moved its Torino headquarters there.  From spring 1996, a
retail commercial centre with around 80 shops, will be open, while by 1997 part
of the university and the laboratories of the polytechnic are expected to
relocate to Lingotto.</P>
<P><I>Milano</I> has several projects to redevelop former industrial areas,
including `Tecnocity', covering 680,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> on the former Pirelli
site at Bicocca in the north-east of the city.  The project, due to be completed
by 1998, will provide a site for part of the new State University of Milano,
headquarters for several companies including Pirelli, a conference centre, and
housing accommodation.  The flagship of <I>Lille</I>'s transformation remains
the Euralille business centre, but the city also has initiatives to redevelop
old industrial areas.  These include a new university faculty on the 35,000 m<SUP>2</SUP>
site of the old Leblan spinning mill, to be opened in time for the 1996/97
academic year and expected to bring life back to the `quartier des Moulins'
where unemployment is above 23%.  Another example is the Eurot&eacute;l&eacute;port
recently opened at Roubaix and aimed at attracting firms whose activities depend
on high- quality telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
<P>Just as former manufacturing sites are being transformed into service
centres, several cities are redeveloping parts of their docks or waterfront
areas.  The development of Canary Wharf in <I>London</I>'s docklands is a
well-known example.  Others include the major Eurom&eacute;diterran&eacute;e
project covering 310 ha on <I>Marseille</I>'s harbour front, with an investment
of FFr1.7bn spread over five years from 1997.  The first stage includes new
university premises and housing redevelopment, while in the longer term the aim
is to attract high value added service activities.  On a smaller scale, <I>Dublin</I>'s
International Financial Services Centre continues to attract new firms, <I>Lisboa</I>
has plans to redevelop areas close to the Tejo for residential and business
uses, and the <I>Cardiff</I> Bay development continues to attract inward
investment.  In
<I>Rotterdam</I> and <I>Hamburg</I> the emphasis has been on developing
further logistics and processing activities to take advantage of the successful
ports.  <I>Barcelona</I> is seeking to build on the rapid growth of its port to
make the city the major logistics centre for southern Europe, handling trade
between the EU and north Africa and the Far East.  Its Llobregat Delta plan
involves the enlargement of the port, the building of a new rail terminal and
the expansion of the airport with a new cargo centre.</P>
<H2>More Competitive Transport Infrastructure</H2>
<P>In many cities, future competitiveness is threatened by pressure on existing
transport links, both local and international.  In the Cohesion Fund countries
(Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain), cities are still addressing the problems
of urban growth with policies that include major road improvements, a strategy
not generally favoured in the richer cities where physical capacity constraints
typically require measures to ration road use and promote public transport.</P>
<H3>Cohesion Fund Cities</H3>
<P><I>Dublin</I> is addressing the problems of its recent rapid growth and the
lack of a convenient bypass by constructing the Dublin Ring Road.  While the
northern part of the road is nearing completion, problems over land acquisition
have so far blocked action on the southern part of the scheme.  Traffic growth
within the city has also made congestion problems more severe.
<I>Lisboa</I>'s regional authorities are implementing much-needed major
improvements in transport infrastructure, including ring roads with expressways
to the city centre, an enlarged underground railway, a transport interchange for
urban and national road and rail systems, and the Vasco da Gama 12 km bridge
over the Tejo to be opened in 1998.  In <I>Athina</I> the major works in
progress are improvements to the road network and construction of the metro. The
metro is scheduled to be completed at the end of 1998, but indications are that
this target will not be met.  The new airport at Spata (financed with support
from the European Investment Bank) has also been subject to delays.  To address
the problem of urban congestion, Athina's municipal authorities have taken
control of urban public transport, banned cars from the commercial centre and
reserved one lane for public transport on the main access routes to the city.</P>
<H3>Cities in the Richer Countries</H3>
<P>Many of the major cities in the more developed economies are undertaking
transport infrastructure improvements aimed typically at improving either local
public transport or international links.  In <I>Paris</I>, last summer's hot
weather focused attention on local air pollution from road traffic and there are
several projects to improve the city's rail services.  A new bridge is being
built to transfer passengers between the Gare d'Austerlitz on the left bank of
the Seine and the Gare de Lyon on the right bank.  From 1997 a new RER metro
line, M&eacute;t&eacute;or, will carry 170m passengers each year between
south-east Paris and the Gare Saint- Lazare, stopping at three stations in the
business quarter near Op&eacute;ra.  In <I>Milano</I>, the Passante
Ferroviario, an 18 km railway line between north-west and south-west Milano, of
which more than half runs underground, is expected to come into operation in
January 1997. It will bring the local railway to the north of the city and the
national rail network together in a single system, and a large increase in
travel by train is expected to reduce urban traffic congestion.  In <I>London</I>
the major improvements in the near future are the &#163;300m rail link from
Paddington to Heathrow, due to open in 1997, and the &#163;2bn Jubilee Line
Underground extension eastwards through Docklands is due to open in March 1998.</P>
<P>London's international transport links will eventually be improved by the
high-speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel.  Other cities with developing
high-speed rail links (generally with earlier completion dates) include <I>K&ouml;ln</I>
(services to London, Paris and Amsterdam to begin in 1998), <I>Lyon</I>
(developing the TGV station at Satolas and pressing for a Lyon-Torino link under
the Alps) and <I>Amsterdam</I> (links from Schiphol to the French TGV and
German ICE networks to be completed by 2000).  In the longer term, <I>Barcelona</I>
stands to benefit from the agreement signed by Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez and
Jacques Chirac in 1995 to extend the TGV beyond Montpellier to Barcelona by
2004.</P>
<P>Among the Scandinavian cities, <I>Helsinki</I> is seeing a number of
international infrastructure improvements that could reinforce its gateway
status.  The coastal E18 road (Turku-Helsinki- Kotka-St Petersburg) is to be
upgraded to a motorway.  The rail link to St Petersburg will be improved and
served by a rapid Pendolino-train with travel time reduced to three hours. Other
improvements include the development of ferry connections from Helsinki to
Estonia and the upgrading of the main motorway from Tallinn to Poland (the
Baltlink project). However, probably the most important development in
Scandinavia is the construction of the &Oslash;resund fixed link (bridge and
tunnel) between <I>K&oslash;benhavn</I> and <I>Malm&ouml;</I> in southern
Sweden, due to be completed in 2000, which will cut travel time from an hour to
20 minutes.</P>
<H2>Strategic Planning Authorities</H2>
<P>Because the functional urban area of a city seldom coincides with its
administrative boundaries, in a number of cities the debate over what is the
appropriate area of competence for the city's local authority has continued. 
There are two examples of proposed changes that were rejected when put to the
electorate: the proposed union between the L&auml;nder of
<I>Berlin</I> and Brandenburg, and the proposal to create a new urban province
(stadsprovincie) of the Rijnmond around <I>Rotterdam</I>.  <I>Stuttgart</I>
has adopted an unusual arrangement to try to address the problem, by giving
responsibility for coordination of planning by the city and its surrounding
municipalities to the regional parliament.  <I>London</I> has lacked a
strategic authority since the Greater London Council was abolished in the early
1980s and its responsibilities were devolved to smaller authorities, but this
may change if a Labour government is elected.</P>
<H2>Medium-Term Growth Forecasts</H2>
<H3>Europe's Regions</H3>
<P>Although the level of per capita incomes is still uneven, the rate of growth
over the past decade or so has not followed any simple explanation in terms of
core/periphery or convergence/divergence.  The forecast for per capita value
added (GVA) growth over 1994- 2000, summarised in Figure 1, also reflects this
more complex picture.  In some cases peripheral regions continue to lag behind
and the gap in per capita GVA grows (eg Greece, southern Italy, southern
Austria, northern Sweden and Finland).  In other cases, a considerable degree of
catch-up is expected (Ireland, Portugal, east Germany).  There is some tendency
for existing divides to be strengthened within Spain (where the north-east and
Madrid have the faster growth rates) and France (where Ile de France,
Rhone-Alpes and Alsace continue to do well), and to some extent in west Germany
(where Hessen and Bayern are strong performers).  A somewhat more balanced
picture emerges for the UK, although this reflects a better performance of
northern regions in the earlier part of the period (that has largely already
occurred).</P>

<H3>Europe's Cities</H3>
<P>The long-term forecasts for economic growth in the cities are shown in Table
1.  The fast growth forecast for most of the cities in the Cohesion Fund
countries and east Germany mainly reflects the macroeconomic outlook for their
national/regional economies.  Similarly, growth in most of the French and west
German cities is depressed by the modest macroeconomic growth prospects
associated with the strong deutschemark, whereas growth in the UK and northern
Italian cities is somewhat faster.</P>

<P>Because it produces the most cyclically-sensitive products (notably
investment goods), manufacturing industry across Europe suffered the most during
the recession of the early 1990s and saw the strongest recovery in the past two
years.  This has tended to favour regions other than the major city regions
because the latter are generally specialised in consumer, business and
non-market services.  <I>Roma</I>, for example, was sheltered from the
recession but saw only a weak recovery as manufacturing plays a relatively small
part in its economy, and its manufacturing firms are not oriented towards export
markets.  However, those cities that are more specialised in manufacturing than
is typical, and those which serve a surrounding region that is specialised in
manufacturing, have generally benefited from the recovery.  Examples include
<I>Torino</I> and <I>Birmingham</I>.  Export-oriented regions in Italy have
received a further stimulus from the weak lira, favouring SMEs in <I>Bologna</I>
for example. Cities depending on port activity also benefited, notably <I>Rotterdam</I>.
 As one of Europe's most manufacturing-oriented major cities, <I>Stuttgart</I>
has been subject to the same trends and in 1994-95 saw some relief afforded by
exports of motor vehicles and plant and machinery. However, the cyclical
improvement has been overshadowed by the longer-term restructuring prompted by
the strength of the deutschemark.  A cyclical recovery has also been evident in
the service sectors of some cities where these services have the nature of an
investment (eg advertising, management consultancy, property), notably in <I>London</I>.</P>
<P>The present slowdown in growth in the major European economies is reversing
some of these gains, particularly as it has come earlier than had been expected.
 The recovery of port activity in <I>Rotterdam</I> tailed off in 1995. 
Manufacturers in <I>Hamburg</I> report high stocks and low order books. 
However, pressure to reduce budget deficits and public debt ratios to meet the
Maastricht criteria for EMU is also depressing growth among cities dependent on
non- market services.  <I>Bruxelles</I> faces this problem at the national and
regional levels, the latter because of the erosion of the region's tax base
caused by population decline.  Job losses in public services are expected in
<I>Stockholm</I> in response to strains in municipal budgets. Public
administration services in <I>Wien</I> are under similar pressure from measures
to control the federal budget, and the city's economy is also vulnerable to the
indirect effects of tight fiscal policy on consumer spending, since it is
oriented towards the domestic market.</P>

<H1>EUROPEAN REGIONAL SERVICE</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Economic forecasting service for business and government in the Single
European Market</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Includes the international annual reports
<I>Europe in 2001</I> and <I>European Regional Prospects</I></H2></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics' European Regional Service draws on the pooled
expertise of the ERECO network of forecasting institutes in Germany, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom. The service provides
analysis and forecasts by sector in <I>Europe in 2001</I> and by region and
city in <I>European Regional Prospects</I>.</P>
<P><I>Europe in 2001</I> is the latest in an annual series of ERECO reports
providing medium-term forecasts and analysis for five years ahead by <B>sector</B>
for the major European economies and the European Union as a whole.  The series
has been published since 1989 and provides an authoritative reference for the
prospects for key sectors.  Its pan-European coverage and authorship ensure a
truly international analysis, appropriate to an increasingly integrated European
market.</P>
<P>CE complements this sectoral analysis with forecasts of European <B>urban</B>
and <B>regional</B> change, again using a medium-term forecast horizon.  The
results are published in the annual ERECO series <I>European Regional Prospects</I>,
which is also produced in association with our European partners.  The series
provides economic forecasts for the regions of the existing European Union of 15
and also those of Norway.  Special attention is paid to the processes of change
in the most important European city regions. The report uses a consistent
database and a comprehensive modelling approach, with the views and analysis of
experts from all over Europe embodied as part of the process of forecasting
economic change in the major urban and regional economies.</P>
<P>These major ERECO reports may be purchased individually, or as part of
Cambridge Econometrics' European Regional Service.  Subscribers to the service
receive other important benefits, such as access on diskettes to the sectoral
and regional data and forecasts, a meeting at the subscriber's office to present
and discuss the forecasts, and telephone support.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The European Commission is very much concerned with the issue of social
and economic cohesion between the regions of the EU.  Is a significant reduction
of regional disparities in standards of living an attainable goal in the medium
term?  By providing answers to questions like this, the European Regional
Service should make an important and indeed unique contribution to the analysis
of growth and change in the regions of Europe.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>Construction Report  - September 1996 Edition</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1>Cambridge Econometrics Press Release</H1>
<H1>Embargoed till 00.01 Thursday 26 September</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H1>Rebound in Construction Output in 1997 to be led by Commercial and
Industrial Work</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes the September 1996 issue of <I>UK
Construction Prospects</I>, containing detailed forecasts for the construction
industry to the year 2003.</P>
<H2>Upturn on the Way as New Work Recovers</H2>
<P>Following the 1% contraction in 1995, construction output is forecast to
stop falling this year and see growth of around &#189;%.  Falls in new work,
particularly in the public sector and in housing, are expected to be more than
offset by growth of around 2&#189;% in R&amp;M, most notably in the private
non-housing sector.</P>
<P>Thereafter, strong growth, in excess of 3% pa, is forecast for 1997 and
1998.</P>
<P>An expected improving performance by UK manufacturers in 1997 is expected to
stimulate greater investment in industrial new work.  This will narrow the
divide in fortunes that has appeared between the slack private industrial sector
and the rapidly-growing private commercial sector (which has been fuelled by
strong service sector growth in late 1995 and 1996).  Infrastructure output is
expected to be boosted by rail and airport projects despite the decline in roads
spending. Recovery in the UK housing market has gathered pace through 1996, and
is expected to fuel renewed growth in housing starts and output in 1997.  The
buoyant private non-housing R&amp;M sector, expected to see double-digit growth
in both 1996 and 1997, will also contribute strongly to the overall recovery.</P>
<H2>Highlights in Types of Work</H2>
<P><I>Private Housing (new and R&amp;M)</I> - housing market transactions
picked up in 1996Q2 and prices have risen by more than 5% in six months.  Houses
are now more affordable than for almost two decades and mortgage rates are lower
than they have been for 30 years.  Although the emerging upturn in starts and
output will be unable to rescue the sector from an overall decline in 1996, new
work is forecast to accelerate as confidence continues to return to the market. 
In the long term, the impact on new development of the growing number of UK
households will be constrained by land availability and a shift in fortunes
towards R&amp;M after 2000 is expected.</P>
<P><I>Public Housing (new and R&amp;M)</I>- public housing and housing
association orders were 22% lower in 1996Q2 than in the previous quarter and 26%
down on a year earlier. New work output fell by 7.3% in 1995 and is forecast to
show a further 10% for 1996 as a whole.  A more modest decline of around 2&#189;%
is expected in 1997.  Cuts on the scale of 1995 and 1996 are not considered
sustainable in the longer term, whichever party forms the next government, and
so some recovery in output is projected after 1997.</P>
<P><I>Infrastructure and Other Public New Work </I>- despite the completion of
some notable major projects (such as the Jubilee Line extension), projects such
as Terminal 5, Manchester Airport, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Thameslink
are expected to fuel output growth of 3% in 1997 and almost 6% in 1998. 
Thereafter, the absence of projects of a similar scale in the pipeline means
that output could fall back in the long term.</P>
<P><I>Private Industrial and Commercial </I>- is expected to continue to grow
strongly as recovery in manufacturing investment, boosted by large inward
investment projects, restores private industrial growth to over 3%.  Meanwhile,
strong UK service sector growth is expected to drive further demand for office
and retail space, and consequent private commercial growth of over 6% pa from
1996 onwards</P>
<P><I>Non-Housing R&amp;M</I> - is expected to continue its buoyant trend
(though only in the private sector) driven largely by the ongoing privatisation
of Railtrack and the consequent &#163;10bn overhaul of the UK rail network over
the next ten years.</P>
<H2>Moving to a Green Economy: Implications for the Aggregates Industry</H2>
<P>The report features a supplement focusing on the impact on the aggregates
industries of a shift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability,
and suggests strategies to respond to this shift.  The supplement concludes that
businesses which define, or redefine, their missions to add more value to fewer
materials will find that they are sailing with the spirit of the time: they will
be in a position to comply comfortably with new regulations and seize business
opportunities and will enjoy a good public reputation. and improved long-term
profitability.  In contrast, businesses that continue to define their mission as
making profits by pushing larger volumes of material, especially environmentally
harmful materials, through the system, will be buffeted by a gale of regulatory
and popular opposition.  They may be able to snatch some short-term gains from
the storm, but they will be long-term losers.</P>
<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company, and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic and
industrial forecasts available for the UK, based on the `Cambridge model', known
as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM).</P>
<P>Forecasts for the DoE types of work (shown in Main Table 1 in the report)
have been prepared using a sub-model which projects each of the types of work on
the basis of its key sources of demand.  These include the forecasts for
investment in buildings and works disaggregated by industry (shown in Main Table
2 in the report) and consumers' expenditure on construction work.  The forecasts
of investment in buildings and works come from the Cambridge integrated
macroeconomic and sectoral model of the UK economy, MDM.  Investment in any
sector depends mainly on prospects for output (itself dependent upon prospects
for demand and competition from imports) and interest rates.  Additionally, data
on key new projects - for example, inward investment decisions - are
incorporated explicitly.  Investment prospects for some sectors depend on
government policy or other specific factors to a large extent, and so
assumptions are made for investment in these cases, namely oil and gas, water,
sewerage, electricity, roads and rail.</P>
<P>The DoE data for output by type of work incorporate the infrastructure
series in order to minimise the difficulties in the new work data caused by the
programme of privatisation since 1979.  However, some problems remain, notably
the allocation of work to the infrastructure series for non-housing R&amp;M,
public and private.  The privatisation issue has been specifically modelled by
Cambridge Econometrics, using data over the period from 1980 onwards on the
public/private ownership of each of the 49 industries distinguished in MDM.</P>
<P><I>UK Construction Prospects </I>is published twice a year, in March and
September.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Why are Services Growing Faster than Manufacturing?</H1>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of Industry and
the British Economy, containing detailed macroeconomic and industrial forecasts
to the year 2005. These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics'
49-sector model of the UK economy.  The  report includes an analysis of the
causes of recent service sector growth.</P>
<H3>Consumer spending on services is growing fast...</H3>
<P>The past year has seen a sharp slowdown in manufacturing, with output
actually falling in the last two quarters.  This slowdown is clearly related to
slower growth in exports and lower stockbuilding, both of which have a high
manufacturing content.  Growth in services has also slowed, but by no means as
much.  At the same time consumers' expenditure growth has held up (less than &#189;pp
slower in 1995 than in 1994, whereas non-oil GDP growth slowed by over 1pp) and
is forecast to accelerate in 1996.  Consumer spending on services grew by 3&#188;%
in 1995, compared with an increase of just 1&#189;% on goods.</P>
<H3>...but this doesn't explain the pattern of services growth</H3>
<P>It is tempting to conclude that services are growing faster than
manufacturing because growth is being led by consumer spending, and because this
spending is growing faster on services than on goods.  However, this simple
story starts to break down when the composition of service growth is examined in
more detail.  Chart 1 shows year-on-year growth rates for manufacturing and the
broad service sectors distinguished in the ONS's quarterly national accounts
data.  The fastest growth has been in transport &amp; communications.  Within
this group, UK consumer spending accounts for as much as half of total demand in
just one industry, Air Transport, and there is substantial import penetration
(when UK residents fly with foreign carriers).  While an upturn in spending on
package holidays provides a welcome boost to business, it is not the dominant
explanation for the industry's growth; exports (sales by UK carriers to non-UK
residents) were as important as UK consumer spending for growth of the Air
Transport industry in 1995.  In the fast-growing Communications industry, about
two-thirds of output is for business and government use, and on CE's estimates
these account for about half of the 8% pa growth seen in the past two years.</P>
<CENTER>
<H4>CHART 1:  OUTPUT GROWTH IN SELECTED BROAD SECTORS</H4></CENTER><IMG
SRC="http://www.camecon.demon.co.uk/gifs/ind_cht1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<P>Among financial &amp; business services, the link between consumer spending
and output growth is even less direct.  Provisional data suggest that the
fastest growth in 1995 was in the three business services of Computing,
Professional and Other Business Services, rather than in Banking &amp; Finance
or Insurance.  In none of these three does consumer spending account for more
than a fifth of sales, a fact that is hardly surprising when the content of
these services is considered.</P>
<P>What, then, is driving the growth of services? In some cases, spending on
service inputs by firms is related to overall activity, including consumer
spending on goods.  The demand for road haulage is determined by the volume of
goods that need to be shifted (including for export).  A key factor determining
firms' advertising spending is the level of overall consumer spending, but
particularly spending on consumer goods (since these are the subject of most
advertising).  Even services bought directly by the consumer are often linked to
spending on goods: the demand for personal loans, car insurance, car dealers'
services and garage repair work depends on spending on cars.</P>
<H3>Services as an intangible investment</H3>
<P>In other cases, spending on services by firms does not merely rise and fall
with overall activity, but has a more pronounced cycle.  Chart 2 shows CE's
estimates for the factors determining output growth in Professional Services
(These include R&amp;D, legal, accountancy, management consultancy, market
research, engineering, architects, surveying and advertising services, and
services auxiliary to financial intermediation such as brokers) during the
recession and the recovery.  `Industrial' demand here means inputs of these
services to industries throughout the economy, including services, and is
calculated on the basis of input-output coefficients that increase at a steady
rate (reflecting the historical trend for these services to account for an
increasing proportion of production costs across the economy).  The residual in
the chart represents the difference between CE's estimate of total demand for
the industry's services and the supply as measured by output plus imports (the
latter are still very small for these services).  What is of particular interest
is that the residual swings from being strongly negative in the recession to
strongly positive in the recovery. Since industrial demand accounts for most of
the industry's output, the residual probably reflects cyclical changes in firms'
purchases of these services.  In fact, the residual follows a similar pattern to
that of company profits.</P>
<CENTER>
<H4>CHART 2:  COMPONENTS OF GROWTH - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES</H4></CENTER><IMG
SRC="http://www.camecon.demon.co.uk/gifs/ind_cht2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<P>What this suggests is that the decision to purchase these services has the
characteristic of an investment.  In some cases the purchase is itself linked to
physical investment (for example engineering, architects and surveying).  In
others the service actually is an intangible investment, as with R&amp;D,
management consultancy, market research and advertising.  The fact that London
has a high concentration of these services (and that some of its activities in
other services, such as banking, also have the nature of intangible investments)
is probably at least as important in explaining its performance in the recession
and recovery as the impact of the collapse in house prices on household spending
in the South East.</P>
<P>The popular perception that growth in services is explained simply by the
growth in consumer spending on services is misleading.  It perpetuates the myth
that the long-term growth of services is driven by household spending on
entertainment, eating out and other `luxuries'.  It reflects a view of services
that will become increasingly outdated in a knowledge-based economy, in which
intangible investment is of growing importance for international competitiveness
and long-term growth.</P>
<H2>Investment Spending to Boost Growth in 1997</H2>
<P>GDP growth is forecast to slow to just over 2% in 1996, as the additional
domestic demand arising from faster growth in consumer spending and investment
is met partly out of stocks and partly by stronger imports.  An acceleration in
GDP growth to 3% is forecast for 1997, supported by continued strong growth in
consumer spending, stronger investment growth and a recovery in continental
European export markets.</P>
<P>Manufacturing output is forecast to recover from the second half of 1996
from its present stagnation, helped by stronger investment demand, stronger
growth in exports to continental Europe, and the achievement of a lower ratio of
stocks to output during the first half.  Faster growth in consumer spending on
services is being prompted by low price increases, due to fierce competition and
the impact of technological change.  However, the services that are growing most
rapidly are mainly serving business markets; some are intangible investments
(see above).</P>
<P>The underlying rate of RPI inflation is expected to remain low, accelerating
modestly in 1997 to 3&#188;%.  The headline rate is forecast to be lower than
the underlying rate in 1996, and then to exceed it in 1997, in response to
interest rate changes.</P>

<CENTER>
<H1>Government's CO<SUB>2</SUB> target for 2010 likely to be met, but new
measures needed for more stringent Labour target</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>UK Energy
and the Environment</I>, containing detailed forecasts of energy demand and CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by fuel user and fuel type to the year 2005. 
These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' integrated
energy-environment-economy model of the UK.</P>
<P>The Government has confirmed a target of 5-10% reductions in UK emissions
below 1990 levels by 2010, in John Gummer's speech at the Geneva Climate Change
conference on 17 July.  The latest CE forecast of UK carbon emissions suggests
that in 2000 they will be around 8% below the 1990 level, and will rise only
slightly by 2005.  The main factors contributing to lower emissions over this
period are the electricity industry's shift from coal-fired generation to
gas-fired generation, and the impact of the road fuel duty escalator on road
transport fuel demand (which we assume will be continued indefinitely).</P>
<P>What happens to the pattern of carbon emissions after 2005 remains
uncertain, and will depend to a large extent on whether it remains economic for
the electricity industry to continue switching into gas, and on whether the
government maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above the rate of
inflation.</P>
<P>The Labour Party's CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions target for 2010 is tougher than
the Government's: it seeks a reduction of 20% below 1990 levels (as stated in
<I>Trust for Tomorrow</I>, the 1994 report of the Labour Party's Policy
Commission on the environment, and confirmed by Tony Blair in February in his
speech to the Royal Society).  The CE forecast suggests that new measures would
be required to achieve such a target, and the Labour Party has itself proposed
introducing further energy-saving schemes and voluntary agreements with
industry.</P>
<P>The Liberal Democrats have for several years supported a 30% reduction in
carbon emissions over 15 years, which would certainly require more stringent
measures.  One means by which more substantial reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions might be achieved is via eco-tax reform:  a shift in the tax structure
from taxing so-called `goods', such as employment, to taxing `bads', such as
pollution arising out of energy use.  The report includes a detailed discussion
of the use of market-based instruments such as environmental taxes and charges
as a way of achieving environmental targets, compared with the more traditional
regulatory approach.</P>
<H2>Forecast Trends in Energy Demand and Other Environmental Emissions</H2>
<P>After a decline in total final energy consumption of 0.8% in 1995 total
energy demand is forecast to increase over the next few years before flattening
out and then falling slightly by the end of the forecast period.  Over the same
time GDP is forecast to grow steadily and be nearly 30% higher in real terms
than the 1995 level by the year 2005.</P>
<P>One of the most important fuel users in terms of primary fuel inputs and
environmental emissions is power generation.  The latest data show that total
electricity generation increased by 1.9% in 1995.  Inputs of gas to power
generation rose by over 25% in 1995 while the demand for coal fell by 4.4%. 
Coal is still responsible for over 45% of the primary fuel inputs to the ESI,
with nuclear nearly 30% and natural gas over 15%.  Gas is expected to overtake
coal as the most important primary fuel input to electricity before 2000.</P>
<P>Key trends in demand by other fuel users are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Demand for energy by industry is forecast to increase slowly until the end
of the decade and then fall, during which time gas demand is expected to
increase at the expense of coal and oil.</LI>
<LI>Overall demand for road fuels fell in 1995 for the first time since 1991,
providing the first sign that the road fuel duty escalator might be having an
effect on demand.</LI>
<LI>In the long term, demand for road fuels is expected to decline if the
government maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above general
inflation.  This would probably be achieved through the use of more
fuel-efficient vehicles rather than actual reductions in traffic.</LI>
<LI>The demand for energy by households fell by 2.7% in 1995, partly reflecting
the slightly warmer temperatures than in 1994.</LI>
<LI>In the long run, household demand for energy is expected to increase at 1-1&#189;%
pa as demand for higher comfort levels and more services and an increase in the
number of households outweigh any savings in energy obtained through more
stringent building standards.</LI>
<LI>Energy consumption by the commercial sector increased by 6.8% in 1995 when
both output and employment in service sectors grew.</LI>
<LI>Commercial sector energy demand is expected to increase at just under 1% pa
for the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting continued improvements in
energy efficiency, although demand for electricity is forecast to grow much more
rapidly.</LI></UL>
<P>In terms of prospects for carbon and sulphur emissions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The switch to natural gas from the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal
and oil is responsible for the majority of the reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions over 1990-2005.</LI>
<LI>Emissions from power generation have fallen by nearly 20% in the first half
of the 1990s because of switching from coal into gas and increased nuclear
generation.</LI>
<LI>Emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from power generation are forecast to continue
falling until the year 2000 and then increase again slightly as the
opportunities for further fuel-switching become fewer.</LI>
<LI>CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from road transport are forecast to grow only
slightly over 1995-2000 and then to fall as the impact of the road fuel duty
escalator offsets the stimulus to growth from higher economic activity.</LI>
<LI>Emissions by households are expected to increase over the forecast period
as the number of households rises and penetration of gas in the place of coal
and oil becomes more complete.</LI>
<LI>Emissions of sulphur are expected to fall by more than half from 1995 to
the end of the forecast period, with the biggest reduction coming from power
generation.</LI>
<LI>The UNECE target of a 70% reduction from 1980 SO2 levels by 2005 is
expected to be met, although beyond 2005 further measures will be needed to
reach the 80% target reduction by the year 2010.</LI></UL>
<P>Key results differentiated by fuel type and fuel user are shown in Table 1
(for final energy demand), Table 2 (for carbon emissions) and Table 3 (for
sulphur emissions).  Tables 2 and 3 differ from Table 1 in that they include
emissions arising from fuel use by power generation and other energy industries.
 Hence, coal use in Table 1 relates only to final users (industrial, commercial
and household use), whereas emissions shown in the other tables relate primarily
to coal use in power generation.  In the bottom half of Tables 2 and 3,
emissions by fuel users relate only to <I>fossil fuel</I> consumption by those
users.  Emissions from burning fossil fuels to produce electricity are allocated
to power generation.</P>

<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>Regional
Economic Prospects</I>, containing detailed macroeconomic and industrial
forecasts to the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These
forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK
economy.</P>
<H2>Extra jobs in the north are part-time</H2>
<P>Over the last decade, the expansion of the service sector and decline of
manufacturing employment have been associated with strong growth of part-time
and female employment.  These trends have become more pronounced in the 1990s. 
Over 1991-95 all the regions saw an increase in part-time employment for both
males and females and a fall in full-time male employment.  Only regions with
the best overall employment performance such as East Anglia and the South West
saw an increase in full-time female employment.</P>
<P>However, in 1995, when UK employment rose quite rapidly (by about 1%) in
response to rapid GDP growth in 1994, employment trends were quite different
(see Chart 1).  All regions apart from Scotland and the North West saw an
increase in employment but most regions in the northern half of the country saw
no increase in full-time jobs.  A striking exception is the North region, which
has benefited from several high-profile inward investment decisions.  In
contrast, most regions in the southern half of the country saw full-time
employment increase.</P>

<H2>Regional convergence during the recession has helped to keep inflation low</H2>
<P>It is well known that since the early 1990s recession unemployment in all
regions has converged towards the national average, with the high unemployment
areas outside the south of England seeing marked relative improvement.  What is
less well known is that this has been associated with convergence in relative
earnings growth, with Greater London experiencing a sharp relative decline thus
reducing pressure on national inflation.  Chart 2 shows the convergence in wage
inflation rates relative to the experience of the 1985-90 period.  This is one
of the classic arguments for an active regional policy: that a more even
distribution of employment growth will improve the UK's inflation/unemployment
trade-off.  Ironically this has been achieved not by design but by the scale of
the recession in the south.  The forecast suggests a gradual reversal, with
stronger growth expected in the south.</P>
<P></P>

<H2>The short-term forecast: faster growth in the south and midlands</H2>
<P>In 1996, the three fastest-growing regions are all expected to be in the
south of England.  Growth in East Anglia is supported by a recovering
manufacturing sector, continuing strong performance in services and improving
performance in construction.  The South West is also forecast to see strong
growth reflecting good performance across all the main sectors.</P>
<P>Although the recent strength of London's manufacturing industry is not
expected to be sustained, growth in services and a strong performance in
construction maintain the high ranking of the region in terms of GDP growth. 
Increased employment in London's construction and financial &amp; business
services sectors underpins a forecast strong overall employment performance in
London.</P>
<P>The Rest of the South East is forecast to continue to underperform the
national average, despite a relative improvement in manufacturing, mainly
because of continued weakness expected in construction as the housing market is
slow to recover.</P>
<P>The East Midlands, Wales, the North and Northern Ireland are also forecast
to see above average growth.  The strongest manufacturing growth continues to be
in Wales, led by the (mainly consumer) electronics and vehicle components
industries that have been the focus of inward investment.  In Scotland,
reasonable manufacturing performance is combined with a weaker than average
performance in financial &amp; business services to leave overall GDP growth no
better than the national rate.  The West Midlands is forecast to see a temporary
deterioration in relative performance, mainly reflecting the region's very
strong performance in 1995 especially in manufacturing.</P>
<P>Economic growth is forecast to accelerate in all regions in 1997 with growth
quite broadly distributed, but only regions in the south are expected to see
rates above the national average.</P>
<H2>Long-term regional growth converges relative to past experience</H2>
<P>In the long term regions in the south of England  and the midlands and Wales
are forecast to see the fastest economic growth, but some regions show a marked
improvement relative to their long-term historical performance.  Wales and the
North stand out, reflecting the impact of inward investment on the
competitiveness of their manufacturing industries.</P>
<P>Following a period in which Scotland grew faster than the national average,
the economy appears to be reverting to its previous position as one of the
slower growing regional economies.  However, the gap between the Scottish and
the UK GDP growth is also forecast to be less than was the case historically,
supported by fast growth in the electronics industry in which it is specialised.</P>

<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the European Union in collaboration
with ERECO, the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the United Kingdom.  The
projections are based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral
Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM), and originally developed in the
University of Cambridge Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project'
set up in 1960 by Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in
Economics, and Alan Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately
5,000 endogenous variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other
coefficients.  The model is continually revised and improved to take account of
new data and advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The current version of the model, MDM9, has been developed over the last two
years with industries defined according to the 1992 Standard Industrial
Classification; 49 industries are identified, and 19 of these are services.  The
current version of the model has incorporated the change to the 1990 price base,
the 1990 Input-Output Tables, the 1995 Blue Book, and the 1994 Regional
Accounts.  It covers the whole of UK industry with its 49 sectors and 12 regions
and is the leading energy-environment-economy model in the UK.</P>
<P><I>Regional Economic Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>The cut-off date for the information used in the report was 16 June 1996.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies and government
departments by subscription to the company's UK regional service at &#163;4,950
per annum, although copies may be purchased individually at &#163;1,750.</P>
<P>Volume 1: xviii+208 pages, with 140 tables, 113 charts and 6 Figures</P>
<P>Volume 2: 176 pages with 113 tables</P>

<H1>Europe in 2001</H1>
<HR>
<P>The European economy is under stress.  The pressures of German unification
and recession have called into question the political commitment to greater
integration.  The future of the EMS and EMU is uncertain.  Unemployment is
endemic.  Government deficits are large.</P>
<P>At the same time, the economic changes promoted by the Single European
Market are continuing.  Cross-border purchasing is increasing.  Industrial
cooperation stretches between countries.  Privatization is sweeping away state
control and intensifying competition.  Other European countries are still
seeking admission to the club.</P>
<P>Decision-makers have to know the relative size of different national
markets.  They have to know how competitive different countries' firms are. 
They need to know where national differences still matter.  Above all, they have
to know where growth will be fastest, in their own industries, in their clients'
industries, and in their clients' clients'.  Understanding these interactions is
critical to success in the changing European economy.</P>
<P><I>Europe in 2001</I> features in particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>assessment of key trends in demand, production, competitiveness and
technology, for each sector</LI>
<LI>analysis of the impact of environmental and energy issues, as they affect
each sector</LI>
<LI>a synthesis of trends in investment activities by industry and EU member
state</LI>
<LI>analysis of the prospects for central and eastern Europe to 2001</LI>

<H1>European Regional Prospects</H1>
<HR>
<P>Prospects vary considerably between regions in the face of changing
opportunities and constraints.</P>
<P>A new transport infrastructure is developing, and it offers some cities and
regions the opportunity to retain or enhance their economic status.  Barriers
within Europe are being lowered, not only within the EU but also between the EU
as a whole, EFTA and eastern Europe.  The completion of the GATT agreement
provides opportunities for growth, but also presents formidable challenges. 
There is a heightened climate of competition - not only within Europe, but more
widely in an integrated world economy.  Competition poses serious questions for
some sectors, regions and cities.  Policies to address Europe's serious
unemployment problem have to take account of a very steep wages gradient on the
doorstep of the EU.</P>
<P><I>European Regional Prospects</I> presents analysis and forecasts for 39
city regions. The presentation is set in the context of economic data and
forecasts for the  NUTS 2 regions of the EU15 (in which there are more than 200)
and the regions of Norway</P>
<P><I>European Regional Prospects</I> features in particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>data and forecasts for output of energy and manufacturing, construction,
market non-services and market services in all EU15 and Norwegian regions</LI>
<LI>indicators of regional labour markets and demography, including working
population, unemployment, migration and employment, with detailed sectoral
forecasts</LI>
<LI>special features on key issues in European regional development (previous
issues have included a review of Europe's infrastructure and an analysis of the
impact of the globalisation of trade and production on the European urban
hierarchy)</LI>

<P>... the most valuable early warning system is likely to be an econometric
model which generates detailed and reliable long-term forecasts for any economy.
 Such models have a distinctly patchy reputation, but some have emerged with
notable credit from the experiences of the last year or so.  In particular, the
Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM), developed by Cambridge
Econometrics Limited, performed impressively in identifying and quantifying the
slowdown in UK economic growth which occurred from late 1989.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>Regional Housing Market Prospects - October 1996</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1>Cambridge Econometrics Press Release</H1>
<H1>Embargoed till 00.01 Monday 7 October 1996</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H1>Recovery in Housing Market to Boost Prices in the South and Scotland</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>Regional
Housing Market Prospects</I>, containing detailed housing market forecasts to
the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These forecasts are
based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and on
its regional housing submodel.</P>
<P>Housing activity in England &amp; Wales (measured by the number of property
transactions) is expected to show growth of 7% in 1997, following an estimated
similar growth in 1996.  This follows the short-lived recovery of 1993-94 and
the collapse in activity in 1995.  The increase in housing transactions during
both years, combined with a steadily growing economy, rising employment and
falling unemployment, is expected to boost house price inflation in the UK from
an average of 4.1% in 1996 to over 7% in 1997.</P>
<P>However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase in
activity expected in the West Midlands and London, but the largest house price
rises in the south of England outside London and Scotland, reflecting their
stronger recovery in 1996.</P>
<H2>Activity to rise despite an expected increase in mortgage rates</H2>
<P>Growth in transactions in England &amp; Wales is expected to continue at
about 7% in 1997 as projected higher mortgage rates (+1 pp) moderate the upward
push that accelerating house price inflation will give in all the markets. 
Greater London and the West Midlands are expected to see the strongest growth,
with both regions seeing better performance than in 1996.  The rising rate of
house price inflation is expected to draw people into the market, and this
effect is strengthened particularly in the case of London by the alleviation
that higher prices give to households with negative equity.</P>
<P>The Rest of the South East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and the North West,
regions where activity has been subdued until now, are expected to see
accelerating turnover as households' confidence strengthens.  In Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside and the North West, the boost to growth in 1997 is a response to a
strong turnaround in price inflation in 1996.  (Prices are estimated to rise by
1.8% and 3.6% respectively in 1996 following declines of 3% and 5.5% in 1995).</P>
<P>The South West, East Anglia and the East Midlands are likely to be leading
recovery in activity in 1996 and to reach levels consistent with their
underlying demand conditions.  Activity in these regions is therefore expected
to slow down in 1997, but house price inflation is likely to accelerate in
response to a firmer market (see below).</P>
<H2>Accelerating house price inflation in 1997 to be strongest in the south</H2>
<P>UK house price inflation is set to accelerate from 4.0% in 1996 to 7&#189;%
in 1997 reflecting faster economic growth and continued strong growth in
personal disposable income helped by a further expected reduction in direct
taxation in the Budget.  House price inflation in 1997 will also benefit from
the price rises of 1996, with sellers in a stronger position to resist pressure
to cut prices.</P>
<P>House prices are forecast to rise fastest in the south of England where
price inflation is supported in some cases by strong increases in activity
either currently (Greater London and the West Midlands) or in previous years
(East Anglia and the South West).  High price inflation is also forecast for
Scotland where economic growth is expected to pick up in 1997, resulting in
rising employment (for the first time since 1994) and faster growth in household
incomes.</P>
<P>The lowest house price inflation is expected in Wales and Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside,  although both regions are expected to see faster growth in prices
in 1997 than in 1996.  Activity in these regions fell sharply in 1995,
accompanied by falling prices.  A greater recovery in activity is therefore
needed before substantial upward pressure on prices is likely.  Inflation in
Northern Ireland, likely to exceed 10% in 1996, is expected to slow down in
1997.  Following two years of strong price rises and slower income growth
expected in 1996, housing is becoming less affordable.</P>
<H2>Long-term prospects in regional housing markets</H2>
<P>The strongest housing markets over the long term are forecast to be in the
regions expected to see net inward migration: East Anglia, the East Midlands and
the South West.  Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by
1-1&#189;% pa over 2000-05, while growth of only 0.8% pa is forecast for England
&amp; Wales as a whole over this period.  This will provide favourable
conditions for house price increases, on the assumption that the supply of new
housing does not pick up as quickly as demand growth.</P>
<P>Activity in the West Midlands and Yorkshire &amp; Humberside is expected to
be held back by a static working-age population and slow growth in the number of
households.  However, rising participation in the labour market is expected to
maintain strong upward pressure on prices in the West Midlands.</P>
<P>In general, in the long term there is expected to be a widening of the
performance differential of the northern and southern housing markets, though
the scale of earlier differentials is not forecast to be restored.</P>
<H2>In a scenario of stronger macroeconomic growth, southern markets see the
largest benefit</H2>
<P>The report also discusses the effects which a more optimistic economic
scenario would have on regional housing markets.  In the scenario a more buoyant
macroeconomic environment is assumed in 1997 with exports higher and the saving
ratio lower than the base forecast.</P>
<P>Although markets are sensitive to any increase in real interest rates in the
short term, in the longer term faster income growth dominates other factors
influencing the housing market, and activity grows by some 0.2 pp pa faster than
in the base forecast with price inflation some 0.4 pp pa faster on average. 
Since regions in the south show the fastest employment and income growth, the
housing markets in these regions see the sharpest boost.  Faster inflation
occurs again in the southern markets.</P>
<H2>Notes to Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and sectoral forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housing
submodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housing
turnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment.</P>
<P><I>Regional Housing Market Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies through subscription
to the company's UK Regional Housing Market Service at &#163;4,950 per annum.</P>
