<P>In case you didn't know, the United States government considers
encryption software to be a military technology, and therefore regulates
its export as munitions. &nbsp;For this reason, NetShade is available for download to residents of the United States and Canada only.
<P>Fortunately, Michael Johnson has graciously allowed us use of his domestic FTP server for electronic distribution of our product. Once you have accessed the site, look in the "net/" directory. &nbsp;There you will find the file "NS95b10d.exe", which is a self-extracting archive of NetShade for Windows 95.
<P>Please note that all transfers are logged and provided to U.S. law enforcement officials. &nbsp;The entry point to the ftp site is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README">ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README</A> (/net/ns95b10d.exe).

<H2><A name="why">Why should I be encrypting my TCP/IP sessions?</A>
</H2><P>Unfortunately, the technology on which the Internet and LANs are
built is inherently insecure. &nbsp;Data does not travel directly from your
machine to the intended destination. &nbsp;Instead, it is bounced and broadcast
through a number of computer networks, until it can finally be grabbed off
the network by the "receiver". &nbsp;The fact is, nothing stops other people
from grabbing the data off the network, too. &nbsp;It is much like a party-line
telephone; there is a polite agreement that other users of the line won't
listen in, but nothing else protects your privacy.
<P>In the past, network <B>eavesdropping</B> required a great deal of technical
skill, as well as expensive hardware analysis tools. Today, stealing data
off a LAN or the Internet is as easy as running a simple application called
a 
<B>protocol analyzer</B> -- some of which are available as shareware. &nbsp;For
this reason, <B>it takes no skill or special ability to steal network data</B>,
including email, file transfers, web data, or even login IDs and passwords.
<P>Most computer professionals agree that <B>encryption</B> is the best way
to prevent this type of network
eavesdropping. Encryption can be used to transform messages into
<B>ciphertext</B>, 
making them unintelligible to network eavesdroppers.  When a message arrives
at its destination, it can be <B>decrypted</B>: 
restored to its original state with the "key" that was used to scramble it.
<P>
NetShade uses encryption to protect <B>all</B> of the TCP/IP data sent from
your machine to other NetShade users.  
While most network security tools use encryption to protect specific kinds
of data (for example, e-mail), NetShade 
can protect your e-mail, your FTP sessions, your Telnet sessions, your Web
server -- in short, it can protect every
type of data that can be sent over the Internet or any other type of TCP/IP
network.  To learn how, read on.  (Also see
<A href="samples.html">Sample NetShade Configurations</A> for specific
implementation strategies.)
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="how"></A>
<H2><A name="how">How does NetShade work?</A>
</H2><P>NetShade automatically and invisibly encrypts all of the TCP/IP (e.g.,
Internet) 
data sent from one NetShade user to another, using a combination of secret
key and public
key encryption techniques (see below).
<P>

NetShade is transparent to the upper layers of the network architecture;
that is,
it runs independently of applications and system features that use your network
services.  This means that it will work with Telnet, FTP, client/server
applications, remote backup programs, remotely published documents, e-mail,
remote databases, Web browsers/servers and any other TCP/IP-compatible
application.
<P>

NetShade is also transparent to the lower layers of the system; that is,
it runs
independently of the network hardware.  This means that it will work with
SLIP, PPP, Ethernet, token ring, wireless, etc.
<P>
<H3>Secret key encryption
</H3><P>NetShade uses a number of different encryption methods that fall
into two main
categories: <B>secret key</B> encryption and <B>public key</B> encryption.
<P> 
Secret key encryption methods use a single secret key to lock and unlock
data; 
therefore, only someone with access to the key can decrypt the data.  This
key must, of
course, be kept secret from all third parties.
<P>

When data is encrypted, it becomes <B>ciphertext</B> and looks like garbage
or noise. 
Ideally, no information about the original data can be determined from this
noise
without knowledge of the secret key.  However, an entire branch of mathematics
is devoted to finding an original message from its corresponding ciphertext.
 This science is
called <B>cryptanalysis</B> (you can think of it as the art of cracking
encryption
methods).  It is an extremely complex science which requires an in-depth
mathematical knowledge of cryptography.
<P>

<A name="algs">NetShade currently supports the following algorithms:</A>
<P>
<UL><LI><B><A href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">DES</A>.</B>
(pronounced D.E.S. or "dezz") This algorithm was adopted as a
standard by the US government in the 1970's.  Since then, it has held up
well
against analysis, so many people have a great deal of confidence in its security.
 However, it is still possible to build multi-million dollar supercomputers
which
can try every possible key, thus unlocking ciphertext by "brute force." 
Again,
DES should protect your data from anyone but a government or other powerful
entity.<BR>
<LI><B>Triple-DES.</B>  This algorithm works by encrypting data
three times with three different keys.  This makes the process of brute-force
cryptanalysis take so long that it cannot even be done by the US government.
 (It is
much more than three times as strong as DES; it is more like a million-billion
times stronger).  Triple-DES is widely considered to be unbreakable at this
time.<BR>
<LI><B>NightShade Algorithm.</B>  This is a "scrambling" algorithm designed
specifically for encrypting network data at high speeds.  Although not as
cryptographically strong as DES or IDEA, it is still much better than sending
data with no encryption at all. &nbsp;In order to "crack" a message, an attacker
would have to perform mathematical cryptanalysis, which is more than most
people are willing or able to do. &nbsp;It is so fast that it can be left
running at all times, so you will never have to send data in the clear.
</UL><H3>Public key encryption
</H3><P>Of course, the main problem with secret key encryption is finding
a safe way to
distribute the secret keys.  Fortunately, a number of methods have been developed
for secure key distribution.  We use one called the
<A href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA public key cryptosystem</A>.
<P>

RSA requires each party wishing to communicate to have a pre-generated
<B>keypair</B>, 
consisting of a public and a private key.  These keys are complements of
one another; 
something encrypted with the public key can be unlocked only with the private
key, 
and something encrypted with the private key can only be unlocked with the
public key.
<P>

This is very useful.  In practice, the public key may be distributed freely
to
anyone (hence its name), whereas the private key is kept secret.  If Alice
wants
to send a message to Bob, she can encrypt it with Bob's public key.  Once
this has
been done, no one (not even Alice) can unlock the message.  The only way
it can
be unlocked is with the private key, and Bob is the only one who knows this
key.
<P>

Likewise, if Bob wants to reply, he can encrypt a message with Alice's public
key; then, only she can unlock it (with her own private key).  For more
information on 
the RSA public key cryptosystem, visit the <A href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA
Web site.</A>
<P>
<H3>How NetShade uses these encryption methods
</H3><P>NetShade sets up sealed sessions between any two NetShade-equipped
machines
before they start to exchange data.  Here's how the process works:
<P>

<B>Step 1:</B>
<P>

Alice's machine sends a "log-in" request to Bob's machine.  This request,
which
is sent in the clear, contains Alice's public key and specifies the algorithm
that Alice wants to use for encryption (in this case, Alice has set DES as
her
primary mode).  Remember, it doesn't matter who intercepts the public key;
it's
OK for everyone to see it.
<P>

<B>Step 2:</B>
<P>

Next, Bob's machine generates a secret DES key at random.  This key will
be used
to encrypt the network traffic between the two machines.  The secret key
is
stored in the memory of Bob's machine.
<P>

<B>Step 3:</B>
<P>

Next, Bob encrypts the secret key using Alice's RSA public key.  Bob's machine
then sends the encrypted key to Alice's machine.  Remember, no one will be
able
to steal the secret key off the network, since it is encrypted.
<P>

<B>Step 4:</B>
<P>

Finally, Alice's machine decrypts the secret key using her RSA private key.
 At
this point, both machines have a copy of the secret key.  From this point
on, all
transmissions between the two machines will be encrypted with the secret
DES key.
<P>

Of course, this entire process takes place automatically, without user
intervention.  All the user will notice is a slight pause at the beginning
of the
session, caused by the slowness of RSA encryption.
<P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="compare"></A>
<H2><A name="compare">How is NetShade different from other encryption
products?</A>
</H2><P>Most network security software products are only designed to secure
specific types of data, such as
e-mail or shared files.  By contrast, NetShade can secure any type of data
that can be sent over the Internet
or a TCP/IP LAN, regardless of what application sends the data or what it
will be used for.  Over the next few
years, people will be using the Internet to share information in many new
ways: groupware, telephony, 
videoconferencing, and more.  With NetShade, you'll never have to change
your network/Internet security 
system again; even better, you won't have to upgrade any new applications
to support NetShade.  (In contrast, 
security standards like the Secure Sockets Layer require applications to
be rewritten in support of SSL.)
<P>
NetShade is also easier to use than most network security products.  As soon
as NetShade has been configured with your
specific security settings, it will run in the background and encrypt all
of your TCP/IP data automatically.  You won't 
have to learn any new applications, or even learn any new ways to use your
existing ones: NetShade will simply apply
an invisible blanket of security to all of your network activity.

<A name="point"></A>
<H2><A name="point">Securing Point-to-Point Applications</A>
</H2><P>A "point-to-point" application is any program that establishes a
direct link between two machines.
Groupware, telephony, FTP, Telnet, videoconferencing programs, and client/server
systems are all examples
of point-to-point applications, as they all establish direct connections
from one machine to another.  (E-mail
systems are not usually point-to-point applications, as most of them route
messages via intermediary machines.  See 
<A href="#mail">below</A> for more on securing e-mail systems.)
<P>
Once NetShade has been installed on two machines, <B>any</B> information
exchanged directly between those machines --
regardless of which application is used to send the data -- will be automatically
and invisibly encrypted.  It doesn't
matter how the two machines are connected (Internet, LAN, VAN, WAN, serial
link, etc.): as long as the link is 
bi-directional, and as long as the information is exchanged using the operating
system's TCP/IP network support, all of
the information shared between those machines will be encrypted.  For example,
installing NetShade on an FTP server
or other Internet host will allow any NetShade user to establish an encrypted
link with that host.
<P>
Since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, you won't need to modify
any of the applications you use to
exchange data.  Once NetShade is installed and configured on all the machines
that communicate via point-to-point applications,
you can keep using those applications in the same way that you use them now
-- the only difference 
is that with NetShade, the applications will be exchanging data across
<B>secure</B> channels.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="mail"></A>
<H2><A name="mail">Securing E-mail Systems</A>
</H2><P>NetShade is designed to establish a secure TCP/IP connection from
your machine to any other machine that is
running NetShade.  This "point-to-point" security is automatically applied
to any application that sends data directly from one
machine to another.  However, most e-mail systems don't send messages directly
to the addressees' machines; instead,
they use a technique called "store and forward."  This makes e-mail systens
slightly more difficult to protect than applications 
supporting point-to-point communication.
<P>
When you send a message to somebody using a "store and forward" e-mail system,
it is first routed to an intermediate
machine called a <B>mail server</B>.  Your mail server determines which mail
server the message recipient is using,
and routes your message to that mail server.  Usually, the message is stored
on the recipient's mail server until the
recipient retrieves it.
<P>Since NetShade requires direct contact between two machines to establish
a secure channel
between those machines, and since store-and-forward never puts the e-mail
sender in direct contact with the e-mail
recipient, an extra step is needed to secure the message in transit (see
Figure 1 below).
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sampf1.GIF" WIDTH="690" HEIGHT="323"></CENTER>
<P>
Once NetShade has been installed on the intermediate mail servers, any e-mail
routed between those servers
can be secured in a simple three-step process.
For example, if Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, NetShade should
be installed on her mail server and on Bob's mail server.
When Alice sends the message, her copy of NetShade encrypts the message <B>for
her mail server</B>, not for Bob.  Alice's
mail server decrypts the message when it arrives, and then immediately
re-encrypts the message for Bob's mail server; 
again, the message is decrypted by Bob's server upon arrival.  When Bob retrieves
his 
e-mail from the mail server, the mail server encrypts it for Bob's machine;
Bob's machine decrypts the e-mail when it
arrives.  Of course, the entire process happens automatically, without any
need for user intervention.
<P>
Although Alice's message has been unencrypted twice en route to Bob's machine,
the points of greatest vulnerability --
the network pathways -- are completely secure.  Nevertheless, this scenario
underscores the need to combine
NetShade with a strong local encryption product (such as
<B><A HREF="www.rsa.com">RSA Secure</A></B>) in any situation where network
data
will be stored on a hard drive.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="web"></A>
<H2><A name="web">Establishing a Secure Web Site</A>
</H2><P>If NetShade is installed on a machine running a Web server, any other
NetShade user will be able to access that 
Web site securely.  As soon as authentication services are available (with
version 2.1), server administrators will also be able to use NetShade to
restrict
access to private Web sites.
<P>
NetShade provides a level of security similar to that offered by the Secure
Sockets Layer
(SSL) security protocol.  However, NetShade is cheaper, more flexible and
more easily maintained than the SSL system,
which requires applications and servers to be modified at the source code
level before their data can be secured.  Compare 
this to NetShade's "plug-in" functionality, which adds security to all of
your TCP/IP applications at once when it is installed.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="lan"></A>
<H2><A name="lan">Securing a Local Area Network</A>
</H2><P>While many people already realize that Internet traffic can easily
be targeted by intruders, few realize that a similar
situation exists on local area networks.  But as more and more organizations
experience internal security breaches
(where trade secrets are intercepted and stolen by an employee), LAN security
systems must become better able to 
defend against internal eavesdropping attacks.  NetShade can protect LAN
traffic just as easily as it
protects Internet data.  See Figure 2 below.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="sampf2.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
Installing NetShade on every networked machine across a TCP/IP LAN will add
an invisible blanket of security to the
entire network.  All of the network services and applications are used in
exactly the same way, but the network data
-- including e-mail, shared files, client/server sessions, etc. -- is encrypted
to defend against eavesdropping attacks.  
Note that since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, any of the
machines on this LAN can still
communicate securely with other NetShade users across the Internet.
<P>
NetShade 2.0 will work with TCP/IP intranets. &nbsp;Future versions of NetShade
will be adapted to offer protection for other types of networks: AppleTalk,
IPX/SPX, and others.
(Note that <A HREF="netshade11.html">NetShade version 1.1</A> can already
be used to encrypt Appletalk LAN traffic).
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="group"></A>
<H2><A name="group">Securing a LAN Workgroup</A>
</H2><P>If you are not interested in securing all of the machines on your
LAN, NetShade can easily be scaled back to protect
a smaller workgroup.  Any network data shared among members of this workgroup
will automatically be encrypted; you can
configure NetShade to allow unencrypted connections between the workgroup
and non-NetShade users, or to reject any
attempts at unencrypted communication.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="sampf3.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
NetShade's flexibility of scale makes it the most cost-effective way to protect
a subset of your network.  Since NetShade
is a self-contained system, it can be managed entirely within its group of
users.  And of course, it can easily be scaled
up to protect the rest of the LAN as your organization's security needs change.

<H1><P ALIGN=Center>An Overview of the Sealed-Session Networking Paradigm
and the
NetShade<FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1>(TM)</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;Implementation
</H1><P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>DRAFT:  June 6, 1996
<P ALIGN=Center><HR>
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>The key design principles for the NetShade v2.x architecture are
as follows:
<P>&#183;	<B>NetShade can provide an automatic, invisible blanket of security
for an entire enterprise-wide network.</B>  That is, it can secure data
associated with all common network protocols, operating systems, and network
applications without requiring user intervention or drastically slowing network
performance.
<P>&#183;	<B>NetShade is designed from the ground up to support multiple
hardware platforms (Mac, WinTel, etc.) and protocols (TCP/IP, AppleTalk ,
IPX/SPX, etc.)</B>.  This unique architecture allows NetShade to be easily
upgraded to support emerging technologies&emdash;IP-NG, SSL, emerging key
management standards, new encryption algorithms, etc.
<P>These design principles represent the heart of Atemi's sealed-session
networking paradigm.  In essence, sealed-session networking uses asymmetric
(i.e., public key) encryption to securely share a session key between two
communicating machines before any data is sent; once both parties have received
the session key, that key is used to encrypt all the data sent between the
two parties.
<P>An implementation of SSN offers several advantages over other popular
approaches to network security&emdash;it is application and link independent,
easy to use and maintain, scalable to all types and sizes of networks, etc.
 However, a full description of the benefits of sealed-session networking
is beyond the scope of this paper .  Instead, we will focus on how the
sealed-session networking paradigm is implemented in the NetShade v2.x
architecture.
<P><HR>
<H2>Sealed-Session Networking Design Principles
</H2><P>The overall goal of sealed-session networking (SSN) is to add an
invisible layer of security to all the data sent over an enterprise's network,
protecting it from eavesdropping attacks.  Since this goal can only be
realistically achieved if the cost per user remains low, a hardware-based
approach to the SSN paradigm would be ineffective.  Therefore, a completely
software-based implementation of SSN should be the primary focus.  Hybrid
hardware-software implementations should be of lower priority.
<P>The key requirements for an effective SSN system are:
<P>&#183;	It must use a software mechanism to intercept and encrypt network
data at a low level in the system&emdash;between the application and physical
layers of the network architecture.
<P>&#183;	It must have a mechanism for securely sharing session keys between
the transmitter and recipient in any network session.
<P>&#183;	It must seed each session key with an effective random number.
<P>&#183;	It must be able to establish simultaneous sealed sessions with
multiple machines, each using a different session key.
<P>&#183;	It must support some type of mechanism for authentication.
<P>
<H3>The RSA Public Key Cryptosystem
</H3><P>Several of these requirements can be addressed through the RSA public
key cryptosystem .  Using this technology involves the generation of an RSA
keypair, which includes a public component and a private component.  There
is a complex mathematical relationship between the two components, such that
data encrypted with one component can only be decrypted with its corresponding
component; for example, data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted
with the corresponding private key.  The RSA cryptosystem is widely recognized
as one of the most secure (and most practical) implementations of asymmetric
cryptography, as determining a private key from its corresponding public
key is computationally impractical for keypairs of 512 bits or greater .
<P>We have found that the RSA public key cryptosystem can address the need
for a secure key exchange mechanism in an SSN implementation, and can also
provide machine-based authentication to some extent.  The actual implementation
of the RSA technology is described in more detail in the section describing
NetShade's implementation of SSN.
<P>
<H3>MD5 Random Number Generation
</H3><P>Another important part of an SSN product is a mechanism for generating
reasonable random numbers.  This is a non-trivial problem, since most machines
have only primitive pseudo-random number generators.  The possibility of
reproduction of random seed data represents a significant security hole on
these systems.
<P>In our approach to SSN, all random numbers are generated using an MD5
generator.  The generator is initially seeded at startup time using a number
of volatile low-memory system values (including the clock).  A process is
then started whereby the mouse location is sampled at varying times; changes
in the mouse location further seed the MD5 space.
<P><HR>
<H2>Establishing a Sealed Session: the NetShade Implementation
</H2><H3>Authentication and Key Exchange
</H3><P>A NetShade user has the option of using an RSA-based authentication
mechanism to create a list of machines that are allowed to communicate with
that user.  Often, user-based authentication services (i.e., password logins)
are already provided by the upper-layer networking applications.  These are
often sufficient, and do not require the additional management effort of
RSA key distribution.
<P>However, there are clearly some situations in which a second layer of
machine-based RSA authentication is desirable.  For instance, a user password
login cannot effectively protect against so-called "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks.
<P>Administrators of security systems will simply need to judge their own
security needs, and whether or not they require the more complete authentication
mechanisms provided.  The session establishment description below describes
the fully authenticated method.
<P>[NOTE: Authentication functionality will not be incorporated into the
NetShade product line until version 2.1.]
<P>
<H4>RSA Keypair Distribution
</H4><P>Each NetShade machine stores two complete RSA keypairs, an exchange
keypair (EKP) and an authentication keypair (AKP).  Each NetShade machine
also stores a file called a "keyring," which contains IDs and public keys
for all the machines approved to exchange data with that machine.
<P>Details of the key management mechanisms used to actually distribute the
AKPs are beyond the scope of this paper.  Key management is a complex problem
with many solutions, each having benefits and deficiencies.  For this reason,
a number of different methods should be available, such as centralized key
services or distributed "PGP-based" trust levels.
<P>NetShade provides a mechanism for encrypting private keys and keyrings
with a user passphrase.  This passphrase may be up to 64 characters long,
and may contain spaces, punctuation, etc.  If this option is used, the private
keys are stored on the disk using Triple-DES encryption with an MD5 hash
of the passphrase.
<P>As described earlier, all RSA keypairs include a public element and a
private element.  The public portion of each user's authentication keypair
(AKP-Pub) is distributed to all the machines which are "approved" to connect
to that user's machine; each of these machines adds this AKP-Pub to its keyring
file.  To NetShade, the keyring represents a list of entities that can
communicate with a machine, and provides a means of proving the identity
of an approved entity.
<P>Each machine's EKP and AKP are generated and maintained separately.  The
keypairs may be of different sizes, allowing a larger keypair to be used
for authentication; for example, a 768 bit AKP could be used with a 512 bit
EKP.  This allows EKPs to be changed frequently (thus enhancing security)
without making authentication management a nightmare.  Currently, NetShade
can create RSA keypairs ranging from 512 to 1024 bits.
<P>
<H4>Authenticating and Establishing a Sealed Session
</H4><P>When a NetShade user requests a network connection to another NetShade
user's machine, the authentication process is activated.  First, a packet
containing the requestor's ID, EKP-Pub, and other miscellaneous information
is prepared.  The entire packet is hashed with MD5.  The hash is then signed
using the requestor's AKP-Priv and appended to the packet; the packet is
then sent to the responder.
<P>Upon receipt of the packet, the responder re-hashes the packet, and verifies
the hash using the requestor's AKP-Pub (which is found in the responder's
keyring).  If the request is valid and unmodified, a Triple-DES key is generated
and placed in a response packet.  The Triple-DES key is then RSA encrypted
using the requestor's EKP-Pub.
<P>Some additional information is added to the packet, and then the entire
packet is hashed and signed using the responder's AKP-Priv.  Finally, everything
except the RSA-encrypted Triple-DES key is encrypted with the Triple-DES
key, and the response packet is sent to the requester.
<P>Upon receipt of this packet, the requester verifies the authenticity of
the packet using its AKP-Pub keyring.  If genuine, it decrypts the Triple-DES
key using its EKP-Priv.
<P>At this point, both the requester and the responder have access to the
Triple-DES key.  This key is then used to establish secure pipes for data
using any bulk encryption algorithm desired by the requester.  Additional
exchange packets are both protected and authenticated by the Triple-DES key.
<P>
<H3>Determining the Encryption Mode
</H3><P>Different NetShade users may prefer to use different encryption
algorithms.  One user may allow only DES and Triple-DES, while another might
allow only the NightShade Algorithm.  Some users may allow unencrypted
connections with their machines, as well.
<P>To address this potential problem, NetShade allows each user to define
a prioritized list of allowed encryption algorithms.  Any attempts to connect
to a NetShade machine using an algorithm that does not appear in this list
will be rejected.  (The user may define "cleartext" as an allowed algorithm,
which will allow insecure connections to your machine; if authentication
is turned off, even non-NetShade users will be able to connect with you.)
<P>When attempting to connect to another machine, NetShade determines which
algorithms (if any) are supported by both machines.  From this list, NetShade
selects the algorithm with the highest priority on the requestor's allowed
list.  For example, if the requester allows DES, Triple DES and NightShade
in that order of priority, and the responder allows Triple DES and DES in
that order of priority, the session will be established using DES as the
bulk encryption algorithm.
<P>If there are no encryption algorithms supported by both the requester
and responder, the session will not be established.  NetShade will instead
show the requester a dialog box listing the encryption algorithms that are
supported by the responding machine.
<P>
<H3>Network Packet Interception and Re-Entry
</H3><P>One of the most challenging aspects of implementing a SSN system
is intercepting and re-admitting network data packets.  Although the specific
mechanism NetShade uses to intercept data is proprietary, we can offer a
rough description of how the process works.
<P>One flexible aspect of the main NetShade architecture is the ability to
intercept and secure data from various different levels of the networking
hierarchy.  This is valuable for practical rather than conceptual reasons.
 Different implementations of different protocols (for instance, Appletalk
vs. TCP/IP) allow for interception at varying levels.  For example, NetShade
intercepts TCP/IP at the data stream layer, whereas it intercepts Appletalk
at the network packet layer.  For the purposes of discussion, we will use
the term "packet" to refer to some chunk of data intercepted by NetShade;
not necessarily a link-level network packet.
<P>NetShade monitors all of the incoming and outgoing  packets.  If NetShade's
authentication feature is turned on, any incoming or outgoing packets sent
to or from a source not listed in the keyring are immediately rejected.
<P>When processing any approved packet, NetShade checks the identity of the
other party in the transaction (the sender of an incoming packet, or the
recipient of an outgoing packet).  If that party has already established
a sealed session with the host machine, the packet is sent to the encryption
mechanism for encryption (outgoing) or decryption (incoming) using the
pre-determined session key.  If no sealed session has been established, NetShade
attempts to establish a sealed session with the sender's machine.
<P>
<H3>Data Encryption Mechanism
</H3><P>The currently supported block ciphers (DES, Triple-DES) are implemented
in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.  All block algorithms used in the future
will be supported in this mode.
<P>For implementation reasons, the amount of initialization vector data available
is dependent on the network protocol used.  For TCP/IP, a full 64 bits of
IV data is used in block encryptions.
<P>This discussion of NetShade's encryption focuses on TCP/IP data.  Note
that the design of the encryption engine is flexible, and that future NetShade
upgrades will add encryption support for data sent over the AppleTalk, IPX
and SPX network protocols in the near future.  While the structure of data
packets sent over these protocols will differ, the basic encryption functionality
will operate much like the TCP/IP encryption process.
<P>
<H4>Data Encryption Process
</H4><P>NetShade performs bulk encryption on the data field of each TCP/IP
data block, and prepends an unencrypted "initialization vector" to this field.
 Figure 2 shows how a standard TCP/IP data block is modified during this
process.
<P>Assuming that the data block has already been approved for transmission
by the authentication mechanism and that a sealed session has already been
established between the sender and receiver, NetShade routes the outgoing
packet to the encryption engine.
<P>Next, NetShade looks up the encryption algorithm and session key that
were set during the session establishment process.  This information is used
to encrypt all the data in the data block except for the TCP and IP headers.
<P>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG ALIGN=Bottom SRC="Page1_pict3.gif" ALT="[Image]" WIDTH="281" HEIGHT="188">
<P ALIGN=Center><B>Figure 1.  TCP/IP Data Block Encryption Results</B>
<P>
<P>The NetShade header includes an initialization vector and some other basic
information about the sealed session.  This information can be sent in the
clear without compromising the security of the sealed session.
<H4>Data Decryption Process
</H4><P>Again, let us assume that an incoming packet has already been approved
by the authentication mechanism and that a sealed session has already been
established between the sender and receiver.  Using the packet's source IP
address to determine the identity of the sender, NetShade looks up the algorithm
and session key that were set during the session establishment process. 
This key is combined with the initialization vector to decrypt the data block.
<P>
<H3>Planning for Modular Upgrades
</H3><P>The NetShade architecture itself is designed as a series of modules,
making it easy to add support for additional platforms, operating systems,
network protocols, and features (see Figure 2).  Separate modules are devoted
to platform-specific processing (memory management, interface, driver
information, etc.), protocol-specific processing (packet processing and
interception), the encryption mechanism (selecting the algorithms to be used),
and authentication (selecting the method by which the identity of connecting
machines or users can be verified). This modular design was chosen to reduce
the development cycle for new versions of NetShade.

<A name="whatis"></A>
<H2><A name="whatis">What is AtemiConnect?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">AtemiConnect is a utility that
lets you establish an AppleTalk network connection over the Internet.  This
product lets you connect your Macintosh to a remote AppleTalk LAN via the
Internet, giving you access to all the data, programs and services on that
LAN.
When used with NetShade(TM), Atemi's network security utility, AtemiConnect
sets
up a <B>secure virtual network</B> across the Internet.  File sharing, remote
backups, groupware, LAN-based e-mail, printing, etc. -- anything that you
can do
over your AppleTalk LAN can now be done over the Internet as well.  (The
client
and server must both be running the AtemiConnect software before the link
can be
established, and the remote LAN's AppleShare security settings will apply
to the
link.)</A>
<P><A name="whatis"></A>
<P><A name="whatis"> <HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4> <A name="business"></A></A>
<H2><A name="whatis">How can I use AtemiConnect?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis"> AtemiConnect is designed to bridge the gap between
LAN and
Internet networking.  The old mindset for Internet use is
that the network services available over the Internet are limited -- FTP,
Web
browsers, etc. -- and that you need special Internet-specific programs to
use
them.  With AtemiConnect, anything you can do over a LAN can be done across
the
Internet, using the same LAN-based applications that you use today.  In the
short
term, this product will save you money on long-distance modem connections
and
FAXes.  In the long term, it will help your organization share its resources
more
effectively and efficiently.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> </A>AtemiConnect offers a number of useful applications,
including:
<UL><LI>Replacement of ARA for telecommuting. &nbsp;The telecommuter can
place a local call to a service provider instead of a long distance phone
call. &nbsp;Also, if high speed lines are available, AtemiConnect can take
advantage of the higher throughputs.
<LI>Replacement of Fax. &nbsp;You can select remote Appletalk printers the
same way as file servers. &nbsp;So, instead of sending faxes, you can print
directly to a printer at a remote location. &nbsp;This allows for high
resolution, color, and no long distance charges.
<LI>Database applications. &nbsp;Use LAN-based database products over the
Internet without modification.
<LI>Games. &nbsp;Some LAN games (such as F18 Hornet) can be played head-to-head
with people across the world.
</UL><P><A name="whatis"><HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4> </A>
<H2><A NAME=ARA>How is AtemiConnect different from
Apple Remote Access?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">There are two important distinctions between these
two
products. ARA uses your modem and a telephone line to exchange AppleTalk
data,
whereas AtemiConnect uses the Internet to accomplish the same purpose.  Since
the
cost of an Internet connection is usually much less than the cost of a
long-distance phone call -- especially if you are connecting to someone in
another country -- AtemiConnect is a much more cost-effective way to share
information than ARA.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> The second major difference is connectivity.  If you
want to allow multiple remote users to connect to your AppleTalk network
at once,
ARA requires you to purchase a "multiport server" -- an expensive piece of
hardware that allows you to make multiple modem connections to a server at
the
same time -- and a modem for each simultaneous connection you wish to allow.
 By
contrast, AtemiConnect doesn't require any extra hardware at all; multiple
users
can use AtemiConnect to establish simultaneous AppleTalk sessions with a
single
server.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"></A>
<P><A name="whatis"> <HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>

<A name="intersec"></A></A>
<H2><A name="whatis">Aren't there serious security concerns associated with
Internet networking?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">Yes.  The Internet is a notoriously insecure
medium, and just about anything you send over it can easily be read by an
intruder.  Most experts agree that if you plan to send any important business
information over the Internet, you will need a way to keep it safe from outside
eyes.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> Fortunately, there is a simple way to keep your AtemiConnect
sessions
private.  By combining this utility with Atemi's
<A
href="netshade.html">NetShade</A> network security software, your
AtemiConnect data will be sent over a <B>secure virtual link</B>.  NetShade
is designed
to protect all the AppleTalk data sent from your Macintosh, making it an
ideal
way to keep AtemiConnect sessions out of the hands of intruders.  (Once
installed, NetShade will automatically protect your ARA and LAN data as well;
see
the description of <A href="netshade.html">NetShade v1.1</A> for more
information.)</A>
<P>
<P> <HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>

<A name="integrate"></A>
<H2><A name="integrate">Can AtemiConnect's technology be integrated into
other
applications?</A>
</H2><P><A name="integrate">Yes, easily.  Application developers will find
AtemiConnect to
be the easiest way to add Internet support to any LAN-based application.</A>
<P><A name="integrate">
AtemiConnect is designed to operate independently of all types of applications,
so this technology can be bundled onto any LAN application just by adding
AtemiConnect to that application's installation disk.  This will add value
not
only to the application, which will now be able to communicate across the
Internet, but also to your customers' Internet connections: they will be
able to
use the Internet to share data and resources around the world.  For more

<A name="issues"></A>
<H2><A name="issues">What you need to know about network
security</A>
</H2><P>Most people don't realize that <B>everything</B> sent over most networks
and modem links
can be intercepted and read by anyone who cares to listen.  Using a common
network management tool called a
<A href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/text/faq/usenet/computer-security/sniffers/faq.html">
protocol analyzer</A>, it is easy for anyone with access to your network
to tap into all the
data sent over it -- including passwords, user IDs, e-mail, shared files,
etc.
<P>For telecommuters, the eavesdropping problem is even more critical.  The
telephone
is a notoriously insecure medium, and there are dozens of ways for a determined
intruder
to access your telephone lines and tap into data sent during a remote session.
 This problem
puts business data at so much risk that many organizations do not let their
employees telecommute at all.
<P>
Fortunately, there is a simple way to protect your AppleTalk network users
and ARA telecommuters
from these attacks.  NetShade v1.1 prevents eavesdropping and spoofing by
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_gnrl.html">encrypting</A> all
of your AppleTalk sessions before they reach the network.  To an eavesdropper,
all of your network and ARA traffic will be completely unintelligible.
<P>
Here's how it works: when you send a message to another NetShade user, NetShade
transforms it into <B>ciphertext</B> using a complex <B>secret key</B> (known
only to you and the 
message's recipient). To prevent an intruder
from analyzing and duplicating your secret key, NetShade changes it
with every new network session, and uses <A href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA's
public
key
cryptosystem</A> to share the new key securely with the receiving
party.
<P>
If you need more speed or more security at any time, NetShade can change
the way it
encrypts your network data.  The military-strength
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">DES</A>
and Triple DES algorithm upgrades are available for maximum data
protection, while the proprietary NightShade(TM) Algorithm scrambles data
so fast that
you won't even notice it running.
<P>
NetShade's ability to encrypt all your AppleTalk data automatically and invisibly
makes it unique among software security products.  Your network users will
never have to
decide which data is sensitive enough to merit protection; in fact, they
won't even need
to change the way they use their network applications at all.  Best of all,
you won't ever need to upgrade
NetShade to support a new network application; groupware, multimedia tools
and any other application
that uses AppleTalk will be secured automatically and invisibly.
<P>
NetShade v1.1 -- just turn it on and leave it on, and rest assured that your
entire network will remain
safe and private.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="different">How is NetShade different from other network
security products?</A>
</H2><H3><CENTER>NetShade is Flexible.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade protects all types of network traffic--regardless of source,
purpose or
destination--from being intercepted and analyzed by hackers or
industrial spies. &nbsp;Security is not limited to a single application.
<P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade is Easy to Use.</CENTER>
</H3><P>Because NetShade is so easy to install, configure and operate, you
won't need to train your personnel in how to use it.  And because
NetShade is so affordable, you can use it to secure every machine across
your enterprise, rather than buying expensive protection for a few
"mission critical" network users and leaving everyone else vulnerable
to network attacks.
<P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade is Invisible.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade is designed to be as inconspicuous as possible.  Once you
have
loaded and configured NetShade, you won't ever have to think about it
again; all of your network traffic will be encoded automatically and
invisibly, preventing anyone other than the intended recipients from
reading it.  And since NetShade won't slow your network's speed
noticeably, it's easy to forget that NetShade was even installed on
your computer.
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade Secures Everything.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade is the only network security solution designed to protect
<B>everything</B> you send over your network without affecting the way
you work.  Now, network security can be the rule for your organization,
rather than the exception.

<P>
NetShade is fairly easy to operate, but because it operates invisibly, it
is not
always obvious how your network data is being protected.  To help explain
how
this application works, we have developed a series of case studies that
demonstrate how NetShade establishes secure sessions in a simple network
environment.
<P>
If you are more interested in how NetShade handles RSA keypair exchange,
insecure
session requests and multiple encryption algorithms, or how NetShade could
be
installed on a LAN, WAN or Apple Remote Access (ARA) environment, consult
the
document titled <A href="advanced.html">Advanced NetShade Operation</A>.

</UL><P><HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="case1"></A>
<H2><A name="case1">Case 1: An Insecure Network</A>
</H2><P>Figure 1 illustrates an extremely simple network with just three
users: Alice,
Bob and Trent.  Whenever one of these users wants to send private data to
another
user over the network, they are faced with a problem: the way the network
is
constructed means that the data will be sent to <B>all</B> the users on the
network.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="11.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
This means that normally, if Alice was sending network data (e-mail, shared
files, etc.) to Bob, Trent's machine would also receive the data, but would
then
discard it after recognizing that the data was intended for Bob.  But using
a
common network utility called a <B>protocol analyzer</B>, Trent can capture
and
record the data before his machine discards it.  This method of network
eavesdropping is essentially undetectable, so Alice and Bob might never know
that
Trent has been reading their private correspondence.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="case2">Case 2: Two NetShade Users</A>
</H2><P>NetShade keeps private data out of eavesdroppers' hands by
<B>encrypting</B> it,
making it incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't know how to unscramble the
data.
 Whenever a network connection between two NetShade users is established,
NetShade encrypts everything sent between those two machines, creating a
<B>sealed session.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="12.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In Figure 2, Alice has established a sealed session with Bob.  Now, when
Trent
tries to eavesdrop on Alice and Bob's network messages, all he will see is
a
stream of white noise.
<P>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="case3"></A>
<H2><A name="case3">Case 3: Adding a Fourth User</A>
</H2><P>The network environment gets a little more complex when you add a
fourth network
entity -- another user, a file server, etc. -- as shown in Figure 3.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="13.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
As we mentioned in the previous case, NetShade can only set up secure
sessions between NetShade users.  So if someone else's machine is not protected,
all the data sent between your machine and that machine will be vulnerable
to
eavesdropping attacks.  In Figure 3, Bob has currently established a sealed
session with Alice, and is also connected to Carol.  But since Carol is not
running NetShade, Trent will be able to intercept all the data sent between
Carol
and Bob.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="14.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
Installing NetShade on Carol's machine corrects this problem (see Figure
4). 
Now, Bob can establish secure connections with Alice and Carol simultaneously,
protecting all of his network messages from Trent's eavesdropping attacks.
Moreover, since each sealed session is protected with a unique key, Alice
will be
unable to eavesdrop on Bob's connection with Carol, even though she is running
NetShade and is connected to Bob.  By the same token, Bob will be unable
to
eavesdrop on Alice's connection with Carol.
<P>
Because Trent is not running NetShade, all of his network data will be vulnerable
to eavesdropping, even if he is connected to someone who is running NetShade.
Everyone else on the network, however, will be able to share their private
data
without fear of being overheard.  (Note: If Alice or Bob would rather not
allow
Trent to connect with their machines over an insecure medium, NetShade can
also
be configured to reject all insecure connections.  This feature is described
in
more detail in the document titled <A href="advanced.html">Advanced NetShade
Operation.</A>)

<P>
This document contains some fairly detailed descriptions of NetShade's security
features.  If any of this information seems confusing or overly technical
to you,
consider reviewing the <A href="basic.html">Basic NetShade Operation</A>
document.

<A name="RSA"></A>
<H2><A name="RSA">RSA Keypair Exchange</A>
</H2><P>NetShade uses <B>secret key encryption</B> to encrypt all the network
data sent
to and from each protected machine.  Secret key encryption methods use a
single
secret key to lock and unlock data.  Therefore, only the people with the
key can
decrypt it.  This key must, of course, be kept secret from all third parties.
<P>
Of course, the main problem with secret key encryption is finding a safe
way to
distribute the secret keys.  Fortunately, a number of methods have been developed
for secure key distribution.  We use one called the
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA public key cryptosystem</A>.
<P>
Instead of a single secret key, RSA uses a <B>keypair</B>, consisting of
a public
and a private key.  These keys are complements of one another; something
encrypted with the public key can be unlocked only with the private key,
and
something encrypted with the private key can only be unlocked with the public
key.
<P>
This is very useful.  In practice, the public key may be distributed freely
to
anyone (hence its name), whereas the private key is kept secret.  If Alice
wants
to send a message to Bob, she can encrypt it with his public key.  Once this
has
been done, no one (not even Alice) can unlock the message.  The only way
it can
be unlocked is with the private key, and Bob is the only one who knows this
key.
<P>
Likewise, if Bob wants to reply, he can encrypt a message with Alice's public
key; then, only she can unlock it (with her own private key).
<P>
NetShade uses the RSA cryptosystem to set up a <B>sealed session</B> between
any
two NetShade-equipped machines before they start to communicate over a network.
The first time these machines try to communicate, NetShade will generate
a new,
unique secret encryption key and exchange it using the two machines' RSA
keypairs.  The process works like this:
<P>
<H3>Step 1
</H3><P>Alice's machine sends a "log-in" request to Bob's machine.  This
request, which
is sent in the clear, contains Alice's public key and specifies the algorithm
that Alice wants to use for encryption (in this case, Alice has set DES as
her
active mode).  Remember, it doesn't matter who intercepts the public key;
it's OK
for everyone to see it.
<P>
<H3>Step 2
</H3><P>Next, Bob's machine -- which allows the DES communication mode --
generates a
secret DES key at random.  This key will be used to encrypt the network traffic
between the two machines.  The secret key is stored in the memory of Bob's
machine.
<P>
<H3>Step 3
</H3><P>Next, Bob encrypts the secret DES key using Alice's RSA public key.
 Bob's
machine then sends the encrypted key to Alice's machine.  Remember, no one
will
be able to steal the secret key as it travels across the network, since it
is
encrypted.
<P>
<H3>Step 4
</H3><P>Finally, Alice's machine decrypts the secret key using her RSA private
key.  At
this point, both machines have a copy of the secret key.  From this point
on, all
transmissions between the two machines will be encrypted with the secret
DES key.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="insecure">Handling Insecure Session Requests</A>
</H2><P>Most NetShade environments will include a mix of NetShade users and
unprotected
machines.  Since NetShade cannot establish secure sessions with unprotected
machines, having a greater number of unprotected machines on a network makes
it
more likely that someone will establish an insecure connection to your machine.
<P>
NetShade lets you decide how your machine will handle requests for insecure
sessions.  If you want to ensure that data from your machine can only be
sent
over a secure channel, you can tell NetShade to allow only secure (i.e.,
encrypted) connections with your machine.  If you wish to allow insecure
connections, you may choose to have NetShade warn you whenever someone
establishes such a connection with your machine.
<P><A name="fig1"><CENTER><IMG src="21.GIF"></CENTER></A>
<P>
In Figure 1, we see that Alice has configured NetShade to allow insecure
connections, but to warn her whenever an insecure session is about to take
place.
 By contrast, Bob has set his copy of NetShade to reject any attempt to set
up an
insecure session.  (Since Alice, Bob and Carl will all be using the server,
the
server's copy of NetShade has been set to allow all types of connections.)
<P>
In this situation, Alice will be able to establish secure connections with
Bob
and the server, since both of those machines are running NetShade.  If Alice
connects to Carl (or vice versa), she will be warned that an insecure connection
to her machine has been established.  Bob, on the other hand, will only be
able
to establish connections with Alice or the server; if he tries to establish
a
connection with Carl, NetShade will reject the connection.  Carl won't notice
anything unusual when connecting with Alice or the server, but he will receive
a
"remote machine not responding" message if he tries to connect with Bob.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="multi"></A>
<H2><A name="multi">Using Multiple Encryption Algorithms</A>
</H2><P>NetShade can establish several different types of secure sessions
simultaneously,
giving you even more flexibility in setting the level of security for each
machine on your network.  Figure 2 shows how the machines in our sample
configuration might take advantage of this flexibility.
<P>
<CENTER><A name="fig2"><IMG src="22.GIF"></A></CENTER>
<P>
Each copy of NetShade on this network is able to support four communication
modes.  Listed from least secure to most secure, those modes are: No encryption,
NightShade, DES, and Triple DES (NOTE: the standard version of NetShade only
includes the first two modes; DES and Triple DES are available separately
or with
the advanced NetShade Bundles).  From this list of available modes, each
user
determines which communication modes will be <B>allowed</B> with his or her
machine.  Any attempts to communicate with a machine using a mode that is
not
allowed will be rejected.
<P>
As Figure 2 shows, Alice's machine allows NightShade, DES and unencrypted
sessions to be established with her machine.  Bob wants more security on
his
machine, so he allows only Triple DES and DES connections.  The server allows
all
four communication modes.  (Since Carl is not running NetShade, he effectively
allows only unencrypted communication.)
<P>
On each NetShade machine, one of the allowed modes is always set as the
<B>active
mode</B>: the preferred method of communication for that machine.  (In Figure
2,
each user's active mode is marked with a star.)  Alice prefers to communicate
using NightShade, since it is the quickest secure algorithm available.  Bob
has
set his active mode to Triple DES, since it provides the most security.
<P>
Whenever a NetShade machine initiates a connection to another machine, it
tries
to establish that connection using its active mode.  If the receiving machine
does not allow that mode, the initiating machine tries to find a mode that
both
machines will allow.  If the recipient machine does not support any of the
connecting machine's allowed modes, the connection will not be established.
<P>
For example, suppose that Alice wants to connect to Bob's machine.  Her active
mode is NightShade, so she starts by trying to set up a NightShade session
with
Bob.  However, Bob doesn't allow the NightShade mode, so Alice's machine
tries to
find a mode that both parties will allow.  It turns out that the only mode
that
will work is DES, so NetShade establishes a DES session between Alice and
Bob.
<P>
Remember: all of these session negotiation functions happen in the background.
Each user merely connects to the desired machine using the standard method
(e.g.,
mounting a volume with the Chooser); everything else happens automatically
and
invisibly.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="printers"></A>
<H2><A name="printers">Printers and Other Unencrypting Devices</A>
</H2><P>NetShade allows you to specify an "exception list" of devices that
can only
receive unencrypted data.  For example, since printers do not support encryption,
you can add your printer name to this list; even if you have set NetShade
to
disallow unencrypted communications, all data sent to the printer will be
unencrypted.
<P>
You can also add the name of a network user to this list.  In our sample
network
configuration, for example, Bob could add Carl's name to the exception list.
This would enable Bob and Carl to communicate insecurely, even though Bob
would
typically reject all attempts to establish an insecure session.
<P>
To use a printer and retain maximum network security, you can assign a computer
on your network to act as a dedicated "print spooler."  In this scenario,
the
printer is removed from the network and attached directly to the dedicated
computer; that computer's only job is to forward print jobs to the printer.
Since the print spooler can run NetShade, this setup allows you to send encrypted
print jobs over the network.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="environment"></A>
<H2><A name="environment">NetShade Network Configurations</A>
</H2><P>
<H3>NetShade on a LAN
</H3><P>The examples presented in the earlier parts of this document
(<A
href="#fig1">Figure 1</A> and <A href="#fig2">Figure 2</A>) describe typical
NetShade-LAN environments.  Adding more or less users to this type of LAN
environment would have little impact on NetShade's performance, although
as more
network users start to run NetShade, the overall security of the LAN traffic
will
rise accordingly.
<P>
<H3>NetShade on a WAN
</H3><P>Running NetShade on a wide-area network (WAN) is fairly similar to
the LAN
configuration.  Figure 3 shows a typical NetShade-WAN arrangement.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="23.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In a wide-area network, multiple networks are connected using a device called
a
<B>router</B>.  When a machine on one network sends data to a machine on
another
network, it is passed through the router, which determines where the data
needs
to be forwarded.
<P>
Since many routers are designed to forward data over insecure public channels
--
e.g., the Internet or telephone wires -- many organizations use special
encrypting routers to ensure that their data cannot be read in transit. 
But
since NetShade encrypts your network data at the source and decrypts it at
its
destination, no special equipment is needed to secure the routed data.
<P>
In fact, since NetShade encrypts and decrypts your network data at the source
and
destination points respectively, this is in some ways a superior solution
to an
encrypting router.  If the encryption took place at the router level, and
D
wanted to send data to G, that data would still be vulnerable to eavesdropping
by
all the other users on both networks.  NetShade's point-to-point encryption
ensures that the data cannot be intercepted at any point in trasit, providing
substantially more security.  Now, G can connect with J, A, B and D
simultaneously, secure in the knowledge that no eavesdroppers will be able
to tap
into any of these links.
<P> 
In some cases, it may be desirable to apply greater security to cross-network
communication than to single-network data.  Since NetShade can easily be
upgraded
to support ultra-secure algorithms such as DES and Triple DES, when you send
information to a user on a separate network -- for example, when A makes
a
connection with J -- you could simply change your active mode to one of these
algorithms.  After the cross-network connection is broken, you can reset
your
active mode to NightShade if you like.
<P>
<H3>NetShade over Apple Remote Access (ARA)
</H3><P>Using NetShade over Apple Remote Access is also very similar to using
NetShade
over a LAN.  Figure 4 illustrates a typical NetShade-ARA configuration.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="24.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In this scenario, remote user F logs into ARA server E over a dial-up modem
connection.  The ARA connection allows F to communicate with any machine
on the
network, including E.  Assuming that F shares at least one allowed communication
mode (see <A href="#multi">Using Multiple Encryption Modes</A> section) with
A,
B, D and E, all the data sent between F and those machines will be encrypted.
Since C is not running NetShade, data sent between F and C will not be encrypted.
 By the same token, even if E (the ARA server) was not running NetShade,
data
sent between F and A would still be encrypted.
<P>
<H3>Complex NetShade Network Configurations
</H3><P>One of the most appealing aspects of NetShade is that it can secure
network
traffic over complex networks, including those with multiple zones and internets,
without requiring any knowledge of how the network is set up.  As long as
your
NetShade machine can send AppleTalk data to any other NetShade machine --
regardless of how that data gets there -- you can establish a sealed session
between those two machines.

<H2><A NAME=what_is_aikido>What is Aikido?</A>
</H2><P><I>"Aikido is the principle of nonresistance.  Because it is
nonresistant, it is victorious from the beginning.
Those with evil intentions or contentious thoughts
are instantly vanquished." -- Morihei Ueshiba, Founder of Aikido</I>
<BR><BR>
Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art with roots in Jujitsu, Kendo,
and Judo.  It emphasizes unbalancing throws and pins,
and the student learns how to redirect an attacker's motions instead of
trying to stop them by force.  As a result, balance and perception
become more important than physical size or strength.
<BR><BR>
The name of Aikido is composed of three Japanese words: <I>ai</I>,
meaning harmony; <I>ki</I>, spirit or energy; <I>do</I>, the path,
system or way.  Aikido is <I>the way of the spirit of harmony.</I>
<BR><BR>
Martial arts are studied for self-defense and self-improvement,
but Aikido is different from other martial arts in that the
practitioner seeks to achieve self-defense without injury to
attackers.  Instead of being a tool for the correction of others,
Aikido is a way through which students become more aware of their
own potentials and limitations.
<BR><BR>
Aikido is not a sport.  There are no competitive tournaments.
The Aikidoist betters his or her self without belittling others.
And because Aikido seeks no harm to others, techniques can be
practiced at full power without fear of injury.
<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=history_of_aikido>A History of Aikido</A>
</H2><P>Morihei Ueshiba, called <I>O-Sensei</I> (meaning "great teacher"),
founded the martial art known throughout the world today as
Aikido.  Born in 1883 in Japan, he dedicated himself to becoming strong
after seeing his father attacked by political opponents.  He sought
out and studied with masters in several martial arts, eventually
becoming an expert in jujitsu (the art of weaponless combat),
kenjitsu (combat with a sword), and sojitsu (combat with a spear).
<BR><BR>
Dissatisfied with mere strength and technical mastery,
he also immersed himself in religious and philosopical studies.
The stories of his immense physical strength and martial
prowess are impressive enough, but more important is the
legacy of non-violence and human integrity he has left mankind.
<BR><BR>
In early 20th-century Japan, involvement in the martial parts
was a competitive and dangerous business.  Contests, feuds
and rivalries often resulted in injuries and deaths.
The formulation of Aikido dates from an incident that
occured in 1925.  In the course of a discussion about the
martial arts, a disagreement arose between O-Sensei and a
naval officer who was also a fencing instructor.
The officer challenged O-Sensei to a match, and attacked with
a wooden sword.  O-Sensei faced the officer unarmed, and won
the match by evading blows until his attacker dropped
from exhaustion.  O-Sensei later recalled that he had felt
his opponent's movements before they where executed, and that
this was the beginning of his enlightenment.  He had
defeated an armed attacker without hurting him -- without
even touching him.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei later wrote: <I>"Budo (the Martial Way) is not
felling the opponent by our force; nor is it a tool to lead
the world into destruction with arms.  True budo is to accept
the spirit of the universe, keep the peace of the world,
correctly produce, protect and cultivate all things in Nature."</I>.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei continued to practice and teach Aikido into his old age.
Observers marveled at his martial abilities, vitality, and
good humor.  He was still giving public demonstrations of Aikido
at age 86, four months before his death.
After he passed away on April 26, 1969, the Japanese government
postumously declared Morihei Ueshiba a Sacred National Treasure
of Japan.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei's son, Kissomaru Ueshiba, inherited the title
<I>Doshu</I> ("Leader of the Way") and continues his
father's work at Hombu Dojo, Aikido World Headquarters, in
Tokyo, Japan.  Today, Aikido is practiced by men, women
and children throughout the world, and O-Sensei's
teachings enrich the lives of thousands of people.
<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=why_study_aikido>Why Study Aikido?</A>
</H2><P>Aikido offers practical self-defense, but more importantly,
it teaches self-improvement.  Aikido is more than the study
of physical techinques.  Proper etiquette, attitude and
behavior are also emphasized.  Throwing and falling are
stressed equally -- one's practice partner is not an opponent.
Techniques are acquired by being thrown, and
practiced by throwing.  Aikido improves not only one's
physical conditioning (stamina, balance, flexibility,
coordination, strength and resilience) but also mental
conditioning:  self confidence, concentration, alertness
and concern for others.
<BR><BR>
Also, Aikido has an ethic:  <I>to defend yourself without
vengeance, to forgive your enemies, and to harmonize with
any attack of any description.</I>  Aikido technique is a
metaphor for a way to lead your life:  avoid confrontations,
harmonize with unavoidable challenges, and maintain grace
under pressure through good times and bad.
<BR><BR>
Because Aikido does not depend on physical strength, it is
attractive to men and women of all sizes and ages, and can
be practiced well into old age.  In addition to empty-handed
techniques, techniques using or defending against weapons
such as the <I>jo</I> (walking staff), <I>bokken</I>
(wooden sword), and <I>tanto</I> (knife) are also taught.

<HR>

<FONT COLOR="#C00000"><H3>The need for the protection and promotion of women�s rights as human rights</H3></FONT>

<P>Amnesty International recognises that human rights are indivisible and inter-dependent, and works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal declaration of human rights, through human rights education programmes and campaigning for ratification and implementation of human rights treaties. 

<P>The Human Rights of women have been specifically targeted by Amnesty International since 1989. In that year the International Women�s Network was founded following the decision at the International Council Meeting, Amnesty International�s supreme governing body, to increase the focus which Amnesty gives to Women�s Rights. 

<P>The reasons for Amnesty�s specific targeting of Women�s rights lie within the reality of today�s world in which; <B>most of the casualties of war are women and children; most of the world�s poor are women and children and 80% of the world�s refugees are women and children.</B> 
 
<P>Women are in double jeopardy. Discriminated against as women, they are also as likely as men, If not more so, to become victims of human rights violations. Few countries treat their women as well as their men. The consequences of this discrimination are terrible. More women and girl-children die each day from various forms of gender based discrimination and violence than from any other form of human rights abuse. Every year, according to the UN Children�s Fund (UNICEF), more than a million infant girls die because they are born  female. Every year, because of discrimination, millions of women are mutilated, battered to death, burned alive, stripped of their legal rights and bought and sold in an unacknowledged  but international trade in slaves for domestic or sexual purposes. Because of their gender women are at risk of a range of  violent abuses by private organisations and individuals. 

<P>The global status of women has necessitated the specification and clarification of the existing body of international humanitarian law, and promotion of the concept that women�s rights are human rights. Amnesty International sent a delegation to The Fourth UN World Conference on Women of 1995, to work with other NGOs and to lobby for this desperately required specification and implementation of human rights standards. In the following text the results of the conference are reviewed and the question of "where to next?" is discussed. 
<HR>

<FONT COLOR="#C00000"><H2>The Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing 1995</H2></FONT>

<P>In 1995 Amnesty International undertook a campaign on women and human rights which ran from March until the end of September, and culminated in attendance at the fourth world conference on women (FWCW) in Beijing in September of that year. An Amnesty International delegation to the conference presented Amnesty�s message with respect to armed conflict and the human rights of women, universality of human rights and violence against women. Members and groups around the world simultaneously carried out their own demonstrations, exhibitions and vigils, and two staff from the Irish section attended the conference.

<FONT COLOR="#C00000"><H3>Amnesty International�s objectives for the FWCW</H3></FONT> 

<P>Our primary objective was that the platform for action, which was to be adopted at the conference should include:<BR>
<I><B>A clear statement of the current impediments to women�s  enjoyment of their human rights but, above all, focus on practical steps which governments will implement to ensure a real and measurable advance in the situation of women in every region of the world.</B></I> 

<P>According to Kirsten Timothy, Deputy Director of the UN Division for the advancement of women and coordinator for the fourth world conference on women:<BR>
<I>"The real battlefield in the fight for women�s equality is still back at home in the context of the cultural, religious and traditional norms that govern our societies. Only by exposing the real situation of women everywhere to public scrutiny can change occur."</I>
 
<P>In the Beijing declaration, the declaration of the conference, governments reaffirmed their commitment to the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. Furthermore they commit themselves to ensuring:<BR>
<I>"the full implementation of the human rights of women and the girl child as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms".</I>

 
<FONT COLOR="#C00000"><H3>The Platform for action</H3></FONT>
 
<P>The platform for action is the document produced by the conference which sets out the actions to be undertaken by governments in the areas of education, review of national laws and implementation of international conventions. 

<P>It represents an important step by governments all over the world towards acknowledging the reality of human rights violations against women and includes the following important declaration of the universality and indivisibility of all human rights. 

<P><B>While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of states, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.</B>

<P>The platform for action advanced several concepts, such as those that promote sexual rights, the valuation of women�s unpaid work, the equal right of women to inheritance, the condemnation of genital mutilation as a form of violence, the concept that women�s rights are human rights, and the need to take action to  curb all forms of violence against women. 

<P>It weaknesses include a reluctance to identify many human rights violations against women which are prevalent throughout the world, in peace as well as conflict, such as rape or sexual abuse and other forms of cruel, inhuman or  degrading punishment. Nonetheless Amnesty International views the platform for action as an important step forward by the world�s governments towards acknowledging the reality of human rights violations against women and girls. 

<FONT COLOR="#C00000"><H3>Beyond Beijing - The Struggle Continues</H3></FONT>

<P>Governments attending the Fourth UN World Conference on Women agreed in the Platform for Action that:<BR>
<I>"the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls is a priority for Governments and the UN and is essential for the advancement of women..."</I> and that: <I>"Governments must not only refrain from violating the human rights of all women, but must work actively to promote and protect these rights."</I> ( strategic objective 1, paragraphs 213 and 215)

<P>In addition to the broad statement above, individual governments presented their Commitments for the promotion and protection of women�s rights as human rights in plenary speeches at the close of the conference. It is now the focus of Amnesty International, UN agencies and other NGO�s  to ensure that governments worldwide fulfil the commitments they undertook at Beijing, to actively disseminate information relating to the conference and to educate women worldwide on what the platform for action could mean for them. 

<P>To this end a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International have come together for the purposes of organising a working Conference entitled "Women�s Rights are Human Rights", to take place in Dublin in March of this year - check this page for further information on the upcoming Conference. 

<P>Amnesty International emphasises the importance of the principle endorsed in Beijing that women�s rights are human rights and will continue to urge that this principle be put into action by governments developing national plans of action for the promotion and protection of women�s human rights, through ongoing lobbying and campaigning activities worldwide.

<FONT COLOR="#C00000">The Case of Jerry Mc Fadden</FONT></H1>

<IMG SRC="pix/jerrymcf.jpg" WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="1" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" ALIGN=left>

<P>Jerry Mc Fadden has been on Death Row in Huntsville Prison, Texas, since 1987, for a murder Amnesty International feels he may be innnocent of. Jerry is half Irish and half Cherokee Indian. His father was from Donegal, and it is partially because of his Irish roots that the AI Irish Section made the decision to campaign on his behalf, though the main reason is that there is so much evidence to suggest his innocence.

<P>Suzanne Harrison was brutally murdered on the evening of May 4th, 1986. Two days later Jerry was arrested. Jerry's conviction was obtained on flawed and scant circumstantial evidence and the dubious testimony of a so-called 'prison witness', to the effect that Jerry had confessed to him. The trial records show that prison employees testified that the alleged contact between Jerry and the witness could not have been possible - due to their housing locations and single recreation status. 

<P>Jerry was due to be executed last year, but received a stay of execution three days before he was due to be put to death. Amnesty International has recently received news that Jerry is likely to have a new execution date set within the next couple of months. Since 1900 there have been 28 prisoners executed in the USA who were later found to have been innocent. Could Jerry become yet another sad statistic?

<P>This is why we need to make people aware of Jerry's case and why Amnesty International is now campaigning on his behalf. Amnesty International believes that the Death Penalty is WRONG in all cases, but is even more so when there is a strong likelihood that the inmate to be executed is innocent.

<P><B>Here are just some of the facts and evidence in this case:</B>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A car similar to the one owned by Jerry was seen at the scene. This car was a blue and white Blazer with an automatic transmission, bright tail lights, large off-road tyres and a man (not identified as Jerry) was seen in the driver's seat. He could be seen because of the interior light.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>Jerry's car was a blue and white Bronco, it had a standard transmission and, because it had recently been in an accident, had no tail lights. It had no interior light and had narrow street-tyres.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A hair was found on clothing belonging to Jerry. The State said that this hair was from the victim.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>This hair was long and blonde, the victim had short auburn hair, while Jerry's wife had long blonde hair. The t-shirt that the hair was found on had been bought the day before Jerry's arrest.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A semen sample indicated that the murderer was a secretor with foreign markers F, X and B.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>Jerry is a non-secretor with foreign markers F and B. Markers can be dropped during testing, but not picked up.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>Jerry was convicted of another offence that allegedly took place at the same time, but in another county.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>True! The drive from the location of the other offence to the location of the murder is approximately one hour. There were two witnesses who could identify Jerry for this robbery, but not one witness who could identify him as the murderer. He received 20 years for the robbery and the death penalty for the murder!

<HR>

<P>On 13 December 1996 Koigi wa Wamwere was released on bail from imprisonment on the grounds of ill-health.  He remains in Nairobi Hospital and is due to travel to the United Kingdom shortly for the urgent medical treatment which he needs for his heart complaint. 

<P>Speaking by telephone from the hospital to a member of Amnesty International�s International Secretariat, Koigi wa Wamwere said that he was "very, very happy for all the work that Amnesty International has done on my behalf".  He requested that his deep gratitude be passed on to everybody who had sent appeals, saying that he believed these had had a crucial effect in both preventing a death sentence in October 1995 and in his current release.  He expressed the hope that he will "get an opportunity to thank them in a better way".

<P>Amnesty International welcomes the release of Koigi wa Wamwere but continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. Njuguna Ngengi as prisoners of conscience. Both are in need of the special diets they have been prescribed in hospital but are reportedly not receiving.  G.G. Njuguna Ngengi has non-insulin dependent diabetes and Charles Kuria Wamwere has a stomach problem, and their poor diets mean that these complaints are exacerbated.

<P><B>FURTHER RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/ airmail letters in English or in your own language:</B>
- welcoming the release on bail of Koigi wa Wamwere for medical treatment abroad;<BR>
- urging that, as a prisoner of conscience, his release be made unconditional;<BR>
- expressing renewed concern for G.G. Njuguna Ngengi and Charles Kuria Wamwere and urging that they be released immediately and unconditionally as prisoners of conscience;<BR>
- urging that as a matter of priority their medically prescribed diets be provided.

<H2 ALIGN=center>COLOMBIA: BELLACRUZ "HOW MANY MORE PEASANTS WILL HAVE TO DIE?"</H2>

<P>The European Union (EU) should take decisive action now to help prevent further deaths of forcibly displaced Colombian peasant farmers, Amnesty International said today as representatives of the farmers continue their visit to several European countries.

<P>Even in the past few days, the paramilitary have killed four peasant farmers from the Bellacruz Ranch. How many more have to die before a strong, clear message is sent to the Colombian Government that justice should be done and paramilitary activities should be brought to an end," the organization said.

<P>Last October, the European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing concern about the human rights situation faced by the 280 peasant farmer families forcibly evicted by a paramilitary group from lands in the Bellacruz Ranch, department of Cesar. In urging the EU to take further steps, the organization noted the EU�s ongoing program of cooperation with the Andean countries, including Colombia. 

<P>"The very nature of that cooperation places the EU in a unique position to demand stronger action on the part of the Colombian Government to protect the basic human rights of its citizens," Amnesty International said.

<P>"An ever increasing number of people are dying at the hands of the paramilitaries who commit atrocities with almost total impunity. It is only when these perpetrators are held to account for their crimes that the Colombian Government will be sending a clear message that this will not be tolerated."

<P>Amnesty International welcomes yesterday�s call by Dick Spring, Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs, for respect for human rights with regards to the Bellacruz case and the organization hopes that this will secure a strong response from the European Union (EU) and its Member States (Ireland currently holds the presidency of the EU).

<P>Amnesty International has been echoing Colombian human rights organizations in making repeated calls to the Colombian authorities to protect the lives of the nearly 2,000 individuals forcibly displaced from the ranch by illegal paramilitary forces operating with the support of the Colombian army.  Nevertheless, the threats and killings by the paramilitary have continued, and the  recent killings of four more peasant farmers just a few days ago raise to at least 30 the number of civilian farmers killed or "disappeared" as a result of the Bellacruz conflict.
 
<P>Brothers Diosenel, Dinael and Jos� del Carmen Toscano were killed on 5 December, in front of their young children by members of a paramilitary group who entered the house where they were hiding in Valledupar, department of Cesar.  Their brother, peasant farmer leader Jes�s Toscano, was killed three days earlier in Pelaya, also in the department of Cesar, after returning to his house to collect some things.

<P>The paramilitary members responsible for killing Jes�s reportedly swore they would kill the whole Toscano family, and are said to have been looking for several months for Ariel Toscano, a fifth brother, who they also intend to kill.

<P>On 22 November, Amnesty International warned of a likely increase of human rights abuses by the paramilitary group operating in the Bellacruz Ranch and neighbouring areas, after documenting a paramilitary meeting said to have taken place on the ranch on 15 November.  A death list was displayed at the meeting, and those present reportedly agreed that the Bellacruz peasant farmers would be persecuted and killed wherever they went, as a lesson for the denunciations brought by them at  national and international level.

<P>"The brutal killing of four members of the Toscano families -- and the very real threat faced by others -- are clear indications that the fears expressed were well founded, and that lack of action on the part of the Colombian authorities is costing more and more lives every day," Amnesty International said.

<H2 ALIGN=center>INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL APPEALS ON BEHALF OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO</H2>

<P>Marking international human rights day, Amnesty International today published a report which highlights the dangers, abuses and difficulties facing those dedicated to the defence and promotion of human rights in Central America and Mexico.

<P>In its report <I>Human Rights Defenders on the Front Line</I>, Amnesty International surveys the situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and concludes that there is a persistent pattern of intimidation and persecution of defenders in the region, including in those countries undergoing peace processes and political transitions. 

<P>"Governments renege all too frequently on two of their most important obligations, the promotion and protection of human rights. Furthermore, they attack those who carry out these activities, or allow others to attack them with impunity," the human rights organization said.

<P>"Solidarity and grassroots action to promote human rights values is often the only tool civil society has to protect these rights. Members of these organizations, or isolated individuals, should be protected, not targeted."

<P>A wide range of non-governmental organizations, individuals and associations - trade unions, popular and religious organizations, etc - are part of the struggle for the defence of human rights. Defenders  include lawyers, journalists, peasant leaders, trade unionists, students, relatives of victims and many others who denounce and investigate violations, support and protect the victims, campaign for an end to impunity, promote human rights education and mobilize their communities by means of campaigns to end violations.

<P>In Mexico, Amnesty International has observed a new, alarming and increasing pattern of abuses against human rights defenders which has meant that practically all organizations dedicated to this task have lately suffered intimidation, threats and even attacks because of their work. In recent months, some members of these organizations have been targets of abduction followed by torture by individuals believed to be linked to the security forces.

<P>Even prominent members of the clergy involved in human rights defence have been threatened and attacked. On 29 June 1995, gunmen opened fire on Catholic bishop Arturo Lona Reyes, a well-known human rights defender and chairperson of the Tepeyac Human Rights Centre in Tehuantepec, state of Oaxaca.
 
<P>Samuel Ruiz, also a Catholic bishop, has also been persecuted because of his work on behalf of indigenous peasants in the state of Chiapas.

<P>In Honduras, many people involved directly or indirectly in the investigation of serious human rights violations committed in the past, both as representatives of civil society and of the investigative apparatus of the state, are constant targets of threats intimidation and attacks by members of the security forces.

<P>Members of the judiciary, such as the judges Mar�a Antonieta Mendoza de Castro and Roy Medina, have received death threats as a result of their role in bringing cases against members of the military. Prosecution lawyers in trials of military personnel, such as Linda Lizzy Rivera, the prosecuting lawyer in the trial of two officers eventually sentenced for the rape and murder of a 16-year old, have been the target of threats or attacks.  Even the Commissioner for Human Rights, Leo Valladares, has received anonymous telephone calls, obliging him to take special measures to protect members of his family.

<P>In Guatemala, although there is currently no deliberate government policy of repression, information gathered by Amnesty International indicates that those working to end impunity - judges, lawyers, journalists, members of human rights organizations - are frequent victims of torture, extrajudicial executions, abductions and death threats by agents linked to the state�s security forces.

<P>According to the United Nations Independent Expert for Guatemala, Monica Pinto, the same situation is faced by  "all organized sectors of civil society and those who support the peace process in general." Amnesty International maintains that these human rights violations are carried out with the consent or complicity of certain public officials.

<P>Practically all those involved in the investigation of the murder in 1990 of anthropologist Myrna Mack have been threatened or attacked in some way: the police commissioner in charge of the investigation was murdered in 1991; judge Mar�a Eugenia Villase�or, author of a book critical of the way the judiciary has handled the case, has received repeated threats and one of the police officers responsible for her protection was abducted and beaten. In 1996, those suspected of masterminding the killing were released on bail.

<P>In El Salvador, despite a decrease in the scale of  human rights violations since the end of the civil conflict, people active in the defence of human rights continue to be subjected to threats, attacks and intimidation.

<P>The premises of the Salvadorean Women�s Movement, the Committee of Relatives of Victims of Human Rights Violations and FUNDASIDA, an organization dedicated to the care of those affected by AIDS, have been repeatedly raided and the organizations� members have often been threatened. The most dramatic incident was the May 1994 killing of Alexander Rodas Abarca, a guard at the offices of the Salvadorean Women�s Movement. 

<P>In 1995, the director of the Human Rights Institute of the University of Central America, Benjamin Cuellar, was also attacked by unknown individuals immediately after taking part in an event  commemorating the killing of six Jesuit priests by the security forces in 1989.

<P>Amnesty International highlights the emergence of groups dedicated to intimidation and the persistence of "death squads". Among the most notorious is the Roberto D�Aubuisson Nationalist Force, FURODA, whose first public statement in June 1996 threatened fifteen people with death, including several members of the Catholic church and the National Human Rights Procurator, Victoria Marina Vel�squez.

<P>In view of this situation, Amnesty International is calling on governments of the region explicitly to acknowledge the legitimacy and value of the work of human rights defenders and to adopt administrative and legal measures to prevent any restrictions on this work.

<P>The human rights organization is also urging greater cooperation and support by governments for United Nations staff involved in human rights monitoring in those countries where the UN has missions.

<P>Amnesty International also recommends that the Organization of American States (OAS) initiate the drafting of an Inter-American Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders at the next session of its General Assembly, and that it include a chapter on human rights defenders in its annual report.

<H2 ALIGN=center>UKRAINE: SECRET MASS EXECUTIONS IN UKRAINE CALLED "BARBARIC"</H2>

<P>Following the shocking information revealed last Friday by the Council of Europe that Ukraine has secretly executed more than one hundred prisoners this year, Amnesty International is urgently calling on the Ukrainian authorities to immediately stop any further executions.

<P>The executions were described by a special representative of the 40-nation Council of Europe as barbaric and in defiance of the commitment Ukraine made to institute an immediate moratorium on executions on joining the Council of Europe in November 1995. 

<P>"This is a shameful number of executions -- only China is known to have executed more prisoners this year," Amnesty International said today.

<P>The executions were disclosed at a news conference on Friday 29 November in Kiev, Ukraine, at the end of an international seminar on the death penalty organized by the Council of Europe. In a dramatic statement, Zsolt Nemeth, Council of Europe rapporteur on the honouring of obligations and commitments by Ukraine, told journalists he had just received the "shocking" information. He said that the executions could only be characterized as "barbarism" and called into question the credibility of Ukraine. 

<P>"<I>Ukraine must now institute an immediate moratorium on executions and provide a timetable for abolishing the death penalty,"</I> Zsolt Nemeth said.<I>"We cannot be satisfied with promises. We need to see concrete plans."</I>

<P>Zsolt Nemeth called on the Ukrainian authorities to disclose the names of those executed -- under a 1993 law, information on the death penalty is a state secret. He said that executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves and their families were not notified of the executions.

<P>After this disclosure Ukrainian Minister of Justice Serhiy Holovaty confirmed that 89 prisoners were executed in the first six months of 1996. He told the news conference he believed Ukraine must honour its commitment to stop executions.

<P>Eric Prokosch, an Amnesty International representative, told the news conference that Ukraine must take five steps to implement its commitment to the Council of Europe.

<P>First, there must be a political decision not to sign any more execution orders. Second, this decision must be formalized by the central government issuing an order to all prison governors that no further executions are to be carried out. These two steps should be taken immediately.

<P>Third, the government must begin to prepare public opinion to accept the abolition of the death penalty. Fourth, it must sign Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, providing for the abolition of the death penalty in peacetime. Lastly, the government and parliament must prepare and enact legislation to remove the death penalty from the country's penal code.

<P>The number of executions disclosed by the Council of Europe rapporteur confirms reports received by Amnesty International that approximately 100 people were executed this year. Amnesty International has been able to confirm five of those executions, one in March, one in June, two in August and one in October. The organization has appealed to President Leonid Kuchma to grant clemency to all death penalty prisoners, but President Kuchma never replied to the appeals.

<P>Birger Hagard, Chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, said at the news conference it was hard to understand why this number of executions had happened. <I>"Ukraine hurts itself by having these executions,"</I>  he said. <I>"Ukraine hurts its reputation as a free country with relations to the rest of Europe."</I>

<P>According to Amnesty International, the relatives of Sergey Tekuchev, executed in October, have claimed that he was innocent and that his confession was obtained under duress. There are claims that the emergency services were called six times in October 1994 to treat him for injuries resulting from beatings in custody and that the prison authorities refused to pass to him medication from his relatives.

<P><B>BACKGROUND</B>

<P>Ukraine committed itself on 26 September 1995 to sign Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights within one year of accession to the Council of Europe <I>"and to put into place, with immediate effect from the day of accession, a moratorium on executions"</I>. It acceded to the Council of Europe on 9 November 1995.

<P>The Council of Europe is an intergovernmental organization comprising 40 western and eastern European states. Its Parliamentary Assembly adopted a policy in June 1996 that any new state joining the Council must stop executions immediately and indicate its willingness to abolish the death penalty.

Most Amnesty groups have an action file. It usually concerns
someone who is a prisoner of conscience or perhaps a
disappeared person. The group will campaign, often for several
years, for the person's release or "reappearance". The campaign
will include letter writing, petitions, local area lobbbying and
press and media publicity in the local area.  The group
effectively adopts someone. We are working on a case in <a href="http://www.usis.usemb.se/human/mexico.htm">
<B>Mexico</B></a>. Please take a moment to read it and write an appeal letter.

<p><b>Manuel Manriquez San Agustin</b> is a musician and member of
the Otomi indigenous community of Rancheria Piedra Blanca,
Tutotepec in the State of Hidalgo.  He was arbitrarily arrested
without warrant by the PJDF in Mexico City on 2 June 1990.  Like
many Indian defendants in Mexico, he was allegedly detained
because of his ethnic and economic background, which the police
interpreted as precluding his access to lawyers or complaints
mechanisms.  Manuel Manriquez, who did not speak nor write
Spanish at the time remained incommunicado for four days under
police custody and was brutally tortured with beatings; near
asphyxiation with plastic bags over his head; carbonated water
with chilli forced into his nose (a method known as tehuacanazo,
which takes it's name from a popular brand of mineral water)
burns, and electric shocks to sensitive parts of his body and
was forced to "sign" papers he could not understand. 

<p>He was accused of murder and brought before a judge who, based on the defendant's "signed confession" remanded Manuel Manriquez San
Agustin to the Reclusorio Preventivo Norte on charges of murder.
 Despite the illegality of his detention, the clear signs of
torture - which were later certified by a prison doctor - and the
lack of evidence other than his signed statements without an
interpreter to support the charges   was sentenced in July 1991
to 24 years imprisonment.  The sentence was confirmed on appeal
on February 1992, despite lack of any further evidence. 

<p>His case was also presented before the National Human Rights
Commission (CNDH) which has issued a statement on his behalf
acknowledging his torture, to no avail.  Since his arrest....
has learnt to speak and read Spanish and, in September 1991,
co-founded a human rights organisation with other indigenous
prisoners: the <i>Comision de Defensa Campesina e Indigena del
Comite Ricardo Lopez Juarez</i>, which has actively campaigned
on behalf of the rights of Indians and peasants imprisoned in
the Reclusorio Preventivo Norte and other prisons in Mexico.

<p>Manuel Manriquez has become increasingly involved in campaigning
for an end to torture and other human rights violations in
Mexico. For example, on the first of April 1993 he joined a
hunger strike carried out in several Mexican prisons by more
than 50 prisoners.  The inmates were calling for an end to
torture and for fair and prompt trials in the Mexican criminal
justice system. 

<p>In March 1994 a recurso de amparo was presented on his behalf, before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Federal District in order to contest the legality of his sentence.  It was rejected in September 1994 and his sentence was confirmed.

<p>At the end of July 1994 Manuel Manriquez began his fourth hunger strike since imprisonment, calling for the release of scores of those reportedly under false charges in Mexican prisons and, in desperation at the repeated lack of effective response from the authorities, on 15 August 1994 he stitched his lips in protest and began a dry hunger strike refusing to take any liquids or solid foods for over a week.  He
gave up his hunger strike on 23 august and was transferred to
hospital where he received medical attention. 

<p>In October 1994 Manuel Manriquez solicitor submitted another recurso de amparo on his behalf, which by September 1995 had not been
responded to by the courts. 

<p> On 11 November 1994 Manuel Manriquez was transferred, without any previous warning, from the prison in Mexico City.  His transferral took place in the late hours of the night and he was deprived of his personal belongings. It was reportedly carried out in response to his
peaceful activism on behalf of prisoners' human rights .  He was
held incommunicado for four days before being allowed to see his
solicitor. In January 1995 he was interviewed in prison by an
Amnesty International delegate, who had visited him twice before
in 1992 and 1993. Amnesty International, who considers Manuel
Manriquez San Agustin to be a prisoner of conscience, continues
to call for his immediate and unconditional release.
