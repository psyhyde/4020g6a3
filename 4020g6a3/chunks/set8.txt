From initial site assessments and environmental strategic planning to final remedial action,
MK�s Environmental/Government Group offers a complete range of services to both government
and private-sector clients.<p>
Ranked third in Engineering News Record�s 1996 listing of the nation�s top hazardous-waste
contractors, MK, through the Environmental/Government Group, serves five primary markets:
on-site industrial waste treatment and pollution control; municipal waste management;
high- and low-level radioactive waste disposal; dedicated facilities for waste treatment and
disposal; and environmental restoration. The group provides clients with full-service
capabilities for hazardous, toxic and radioactive waste (HTRW) management.
These capabilities include waste-management strategies; system and facility design and
construction; contaminated site remediation; and facility decontamination and
decommissioning.<p>
Three federal agencies, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and the
Environmental Protection Agency are the group�s primary public-sector clients and this
work includes some of the largest environmental undertakings in history.
The group serves as the remedial action contractor for the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial
Action (UMTRA) Project, a 700-site restoration effort in 10 states. In Missouri,
an MK team serves as project management contractor at the Weldon Spring Superfund Site,
a remediation project with an estimated cost of $900 million. MK is a major subcontractor,
providing environmental restoration and waste-management services for the multibillion-dollar
cleanup of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology site near Denver.
These long-term environmental restoration programs at Rocky Flats, Weldon Spring,
and five plant sites under DOE�s Oak Ridge Operations will provide revenue to MK through
the year 2000 and beyond.<p>
For the Defense Nuclear Agency, work is underway internationally for the second of two projects
to neutralize intercontinental ballistic missiles in the former Soviet states under the Cooperative
Threat Reduction Program.<p>
An Environmental Response Action Contract (ERAC) awarded by the Navy involves remediation
work at installations in a 22-state area of the central U.S. and has a ceiling of $300 million.
Under two $50-million contracts with the Army Corps of Engineers, MK is also performing
remedial actions at military installations in Hawaii, Southern California, Southern Nevada,
and Arizona as well as demolition/remediation at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in
northern Idaho.<p>
For private clients, the group has undertaken cleanup projects at a variety of sites,
including manufacturing plants, abandoned oil refineries or refinery waste dumps, mine sites
and solid-waste landfills.<p>
A team of Emkayans, under contract to Shell and its counsel, has been involved in the
remediation of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado for the past decade --
an effort that recently resulted in the signing of the Record of Decision that spells out the
final cleanup of this site located adjacent to Denver. Ultimately destined to serve as a
Wildlife Refuge, the site has already undergone large-scale interim remedial actions,
including the treatment and recycling of approximately 11 million gallons of liquid waste
from past weapons production and chemical manufacturing,
which earned an MK-led team a certificate for Outstanding Performance.<p>
In Oklahoma, MK provided remedial design and technical and support services during
remediation of the Sand Springs Petrochemical Complex Superfund site that recently was
brought to a successful completion ahead of schedule. Almost 100,000 cubic yards of acid
and oily sludge was excavated and treated on site. The treated material was then buried in its
original location in a secure landfill. In Arkansas, the group operated the first commercial
incineration facility certified for dioxin waste in North America. <p>
Currently, the group is providing construction services during cleanup of an aluminum plant for
Alcoa in New York, engineering a major tailings modernization project for Kennecott Utah
Copper near Salt Lake City, and managing construction of a new gold mine for an AMAX
subsidiary near Fairbanks, Alaska. In Texas, MK�s CF Systems is implementing a $24-million
full-scale remediation and waste treatment operation at the United Creosoting Superfund Site.
Selected as the site�s technology of choice by EPA Region VI and the Texas Water Commission,
CF Systems provides proprietary solvent extraction technology for the treatment and
recycling of petroleum wastes and for remediation of contaminated soils and wastewater.<p>
The Company�s environmental services are supported by professionals in technical disciplines
such as environmental engineering and related environmental sciences, engineering geology,
surface and groundwater hydrology, atmospheric science, chemistry, geochemistry, civil and
mechanical engineering, process engineering, chemical engineering, construction and
construction management. <p>

<h2>Industrial/Process Division</h2>
MK has been serving a broad range of industrial customers from its Cleveland office for more than 
45 years. Today, the Industrial/Process Division�s markets include food and beverage, automotive,
general manufacturing, oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.<p>
A key component of the division�s marketing strategy is to closely align with clients to develop
long-term client partnerships. The result is repeat business for MK and cost savings for clients
due to gains in efficiencies and speed developed through on-the-job experience.<p>
Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Du Pont, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Geon, Sun Company and
Pepsi-Cola are among the major international clients who have turned to MK for repeat business.
MK is a leader in the concept of partnering that brings a spirit of teamwork to industrial projects.
MK has long been at the forefront of engineering technologies and today the company�s capabilities
include computer-aided design, three-dimensional modeling, simulation, computer-integrated
manufacturing, systems integration and computer networking.
Total Quality Management is a concept that is a key part of many MK services to industrial clients.
The wide-range and geographic reach of the Industrial/Process Division�s services are
demonstrated by a renown roster of major projects. In the U.S., MK recently completed the
4.2-million-square-foot Saturn plant for General Motors in Tennessee, a state-of-the art brewery
for Anheuser-Busch in Georgia and currently is performing plant renovation and upgrades at
several GM sites around the country. The division also has ongoing domestic projects for
long-term clients Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Du Pont and for Sun Company at refineries in the U.S.
and Puerto Rico.<p>
The division�s impressive international growth has helped maintain MK�s presence around the
globe with automotive projects for GM in Mexico, Ford in Vietnam, Chrysler in Argentina and Brazil
and Adam Opel AG in Poland and Thailand. The list includes Du Pont�s adipic acid projects in
Singapore and Monsanto�s polymer plant in Thailand. Joint-venture projects in England include
SmithKline Beecham�s pharmaceutical science park, the 1.6-million-square-foot Glaxo Wellcome
Medicines Research Center and construction-management responsibilities for the
British Airport Authority and British Airways at Heathrow Airport.<p>
MK has had significant success in Mexico with MK-FINSA joint-venture projects for eight major
U.S. companies and in numerous locations in China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and former states
of the Soviet Union for the U.S. Department of State.<p>
MK�s technical capabilities, responsiveness and performance are recognized internationally.
The Glaxo Wellcome project in England, where the MK-Laing joint venture served as construction
manager, won the British Construction Industry�s prestigious Supreme Award for 1995.
MK also was named �Construction Manager of the Year,� by General Motors.
Only 154 of GM�s 30,000 worldwide suppliers were selected for this annual award.<p>
The division also services public institutional markets with construction or construction
management of prisons, schools and health-care facilities. For example, earlier this year the
company and a joint venture partner were awarded a contract to manage construction of a
658-cell regional jail in Virginia.<p>

<h2>Power Division</h2>
Few firms offer the complete range of services provided by the Power Division which engages
in the design, construction, retrofit, maintenance and decommissioning of power plants fueled
by coal, nuclear, oil, gas, geothermal and municipal solid waste. MK has constructed more than
150 power plants with a capacity of more than 40,000 megawatts.<p>
Long-time experience in the design and construction of new power plants has led to leadership
positions in many related markets. Experience and expertise in the installation of high-technology
flue-gas desulfurization systems at coal-fired power plants allows the Power Division to help
utilities meet provisions of clean-air legislation. Currently, the division is managing installation
of three replacement scrubbers at the 2,250-megawatt-capacity Navajo Station Power Plant in
Arizona, one of the largest such projects in the country.<p>
MK has been part of the nuclear power industry since its inception in the 1940s.
Today, the Power Division provides the industry with decommissioning and dismantling
services and presently is part of a team providing these services at Public Service Company
of Colorado�s Fort St. Vrain plant. The division also has strong capabilities in nuclear retrofit work,
including highly complex steam-generator replacements. MK is one of two U.S. companies
that have successfully performed these projects.<p>
As investor-owned utilities meet the competition and deregulations precipitated by the 1992
Energy Policy Act, many are planning to outsource such operations as maintenance and
modifications. The Power Division is part of a team that provides these services for the fossil-fuel
and hydropower facilities in the vast Tennessee Valley Authority system.
The team recently received a three-year contract extension, worth $256 million.<p>

<td valign=top>
MK has served the mining industry for more than 50 years and today the company�s Mining Group
operates mines in the United States and Germany and offers a wide range of mine development,
operations, engineering and reclamation capabilities on an international basis.<p>
The inclusion of Washington Construction Company�s mining operations into the Mining Group
expands the group�s revenue base and brings together two organizations that are like minded
in respect to maintaining cost-efficient projects where the health and safety of the work force is
of paramount importance.<p>
The group, based in San Antonio, Texas, operates a surface lignite mine near San Antonio that
provides three million tons of fuel per year for the nearby power plant of the mine�s owner,
San Miguel Electric Cooperative. In eastern Montana, the group operates a surface coal mine for
Westmoreland Resources, Inc. The approximately four million tons of coal produced annually at
this workings are loaded onto unit trains for transport to Midwestern power plants. Morrison
Knudsen Corporation owns a 24-percent interest in Westmoreland Resources.<p>
Add to this list of major U.S. contract mining operations, the Bullfrog Mine some 120 north of
Las Vegas, Nevada. Since 1988, Washington Construction has been mining and hauling up to
30 million tons of ore and waste per year from this workings, one of the largest gold mines in
the country. Two other Washington Construction contract operations that are now part of the
Mining Group are a quartzite mine and a limestone mine, both located in southern Idaho.<p>
Internationally, MK owns a one-third interest in MIBRAG, a coal mining and industrial firm in
Germany. In addition, the Mining Group operates three surface lignite mines under a contract
with MIBRAG. These mines produce a total of approximately 18 million tons of the brown coal
annually.<p>
The group began mining operations for MIBRAG in 1994 and since that time has dramatically
improved efficiency and safety by introducing modern western mining methods and equipment
to the mines that just a few years ago were state-owned entities in the former East Germany.
Recently, the MIBRAG mines achieved a record of 1.7 million working hours without a lost-time
accident � a record that exceeded goals set at the start of the program and that was an all-time
high in the history of coal mining in Germany.<p>
Target market areas for MK�s mining expertise include eastern Europe, South America,
Indonesia and selected southeast Asian countries. Earlier this year, an MK-led joint venture
was awarded an engineering, procurement and construction-management contract for installation
of coal processing, stockpiling and ship-loading equipment for a 3.8-million-ton-capacity
surface mine in Indonesia.<p>
MK serves the engineering needs of the mining industry with cutting-edge technology and
a wide range of capabilities. The Mining Group�s engineering operations provide services in
mining and civil engineering, and in surface and groundwater hydrology for mine design,
development, operations and environmental restoration.<p>
The group meets the geoscience needs of its clients with reserve evaluation, modeling and
fuel quality analysis. Extensive reclamation of MK-operated mines is the foundation of the
group�s environmental operations that includes expertise in range management,
threatened/endangered species, wildlife management, water quality, soil science, agricultural
engineering and wetlands.<p>
State-of-the-art technology in mine planning and resource development is augmented by
Auto Cad services, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), including ArcInfo and ArcCad,
and a full range of training and applications services related to the MINCOM mine planning
software.<p>

The combination of Washington Construction and MK heavy civil construction operations has
created a preeminent constructive force with the experience, reputation for quality performance,
highly skilled cadre of professionals and financial strength to compete for, win and successfully
complete large and complex infrastructure projects anywhere in the world.<p>
This revitalized MK Heavy Civil Construction Group is one of the largest organizations of its
kind in the United States, with proven operational expertise in constructing highways, bridges
and tunnels; airport and marine port facilities; rail lines; and water-distribution and storage
systems.<p>
Two recent projects epitomize the management skills, resourcefulness, responsiveness to
client needs and can-do attitude that is found in all of the group�s undertakings.
In 1994, following the devastating Northridge earthquake in southern California,
Washington Construction went to work for the California Department of Transportation
on the emergency repair of a heavily damaged critical freeway interchange in Los Angeles.
After mobilizing rapidly, crews worked 24 hours a day, seven days per week.
The project was completed in just 100 days, 36 days ahead of schedule -- restoring a
vital transportation link for hundreds of thousands of citizens.<p>
Earlier this year, MK was called on by the Oregon Department of Transportation to repair
two mountain highways decimated by heavy flooding. An MK team was on the job within
hours of the first call from ODOT and worked around the clock to open numerous slides that
had blocked a highway and isolated two small towns. MK then moved on to badly damaged
Highway 6, a key route to coastal recreation areas. After extensive roadbed repairs were
undertaken, this project was completed in less than two months, more than a month earlier
than expected.<p>
While these projects were relatively small and short in duration, the performance that
produced successful results applies to major projects, such as the $384-million Eastside
Reservoir Project in southern California that was awarded to a Washington Construction
joint-venture earlier this year.<p>
The group�s skills at completing complex projects on time and within budget are augmented
by project development and financing capabilities in public-private partnerships or in
association with commercial clients.<p>
An example of the group�s overall abilities is the E-470 beltway project in Denver. MK served
as an agent for the E-470 Public Highway Authority to develop and implement a plan of finance
to fund all of the costs of the project to build two major segments of the beltway that will
connect Denver with the city�s new international airport.<p>
Following MK�s successful development and implementation of the financing plan, the
Authority awarded an MK-led limited liability company, a $321-million contract to design and
build the two segments, a 29-mile-long project that will take 46 months to complete.
Toll roads and projects similar in scope to E-470 will continue as one of the group�s primary
markets worldwide. MK and a joint-venture associate recently were selected by the
Commonwealth Transportation Board of Virginia to finance, design, construct and operate
a connector road near Richmond that is expected to cost in excess of $250 million.<p>
One of the strengths Washington Construction brings to the merger is highway and bridge
construction, especially in California where Washington has been a dominant force for years.
Among present projects are sections of the earthquake-damaged Cypress Freeway in
Oakland for $166 million, a $48-million interchange project in San Diego and a $32-million
freeway widening job in San Bernardino.<p>
Another area of considerable focus is the Middle East where MK already has a strong
presence. Among recent projects in the region are several water-resource jobs in Egypt,
including wastewater-treatment plants at Ismailia near the Suez Canal and at Port Said
on the Mediterranean coast.<p>
Marine construction is an MK specialty and the group recently completed the $230-million
Third Harbor Tunnel, an underwater tube tunnel in Boston Harbor for a four-lane highway
connecting the city with Logan International Airport. The tunnel was selected as the Outstanding
Civil Achievement by the American Society of Civil Engineers.<p>

&quot;Kali Gandaki is an exciting opportunity to utilize MK's heritage of 'Can 
Do' frontier spirit and extensive hydropower know-how to tackle formidable 
terrain and improve life in far-off locations.&quot;  This  hydroelectric
facility will be able to operate year-round from the river's power, 
protecting populated areas in and around Kathmandu from brownouts and 
blackouts.

<p>
     MK has been developing water-resource projects and designing and 
constructing hydroelectric facilities for over half a century in more than 
50 countries around the world.


<p>
Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912, serves the

RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL PAT STEVENS JOINS MK AS VICE PRESIDENT<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Major General Pat Stevens IV, a 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army

MK WINS $200 MILLION ROLE IN NUCLEAR CLEANUP JOB AT INEL<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE: MK), as part of a team led by 
BNFL Inc., will perform engineering and construction services totaling 
more than $200 million for the largest privatization effort ever 
undertaken at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) by the
Department of Energy (DOE).<P>
     The total life cycle cost of the project will total $1.189 billion 
and involves the design, construction, and operation of the Advanced Mixed 
Waste Treatment Facility (AMWTP) to meet the milestones -- agreed to by 
DOE and the State of Idaho -- for getting nuclear waste out of Idaho.  In 
addition to Morrison Knudsen, the team led by BNFL Inc. includes: Science 
Applications International Corporation (SAIC), BNFL Engineering Ltd. 
(BEL), GTS Duratek, Manufacturing Sciences Corporation (MSC), Rocky 
Mountain Remediation Services, L.L.C. (RMRS), and Pajarito Scientific 
Corporation (PSC).<P>
     BNFL Inc. is the American subsidiary of BNFL, an international 
nuclear fuel-cycle and radioactive waste management services company 
headquartered in the United Kingdom.  BNFL brings 50 years experience in 
the design, licensing, construction and operation of private nuclear
facilities and has completed $12 billion in fixed-price capital projects 
since 1980.  BNFL Inc. has several contracts at DOE sites throughout the 
U.S.<P>
     In making the announcement, MK President and Chief Executive Officer 
Robert A. Tinstman noted that RMRS, jointly owned by MK and BNFL, is the 
environmental restoration and waste management contractor at the Rocky 
Flats Site in Colorado, where a majority of the waste to be treated at the 
INEL Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility was produced. INEL's AMWTP
facility will treat at least 99 percent of approximately 65,000 cubic 
meters of transuranic and alpha wastes currently stored at INEL, and have 
additional flexibility and capacity to treat an additional 20,000 cubic 
meters of optional waste.<P>
     The facility's integrated treatment process will achieve an overall 
waste volume reduction of more than 65 percent, and will result in waste 
forms that can be accepted either by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 
(WIPP) or a low level waste storage/disposal facility.  To treat the 
plutonium-contaminated mixed waste at the INEL, the BNFL team will employ 
proven technologies from its Sellafield site in the United Kingdom, 
including two waste encapsulation plants and a waste treatment complex 
designed to treat plutonium-contaminated waste at much greater levels of 
contamination than the waste which will be treated at the INEL's AMWTP.<P>
     The AMWTP contract will be executed in three phases.  In Phase I,  
which extends through 1999, the BNFL Inc. team will obtain permits and the 
authorization basis for facility operations, and MK will assist in 
finalizing the design and business approach.  In Phase II, MK will manage
construction of the facility to meet the completion date of December 31, 
2002.  Phase III extends through 2015 and will entail plant operations, 
waste treatment, and transportation of the waste out of Idaho.<P>
<UL>
     <LI><B>Morrison Knudsen Corporation</B> has more than five decades of experience 
in the nuclear industry, including more than 40 years at the INEL.  MK 
will be responsible for all architectural, engineering and construction 
management services associated with the AMWTP.</LI>
     <LI><B>SAIC</B>, which has been a part of INEL since the 1970s, will provide all 
permitting and regulatory support, working with both the stakeholders and 
the regulators to ensure a safe and effective treatment facility is built 
and operated.</LI>
     <LI><B>BEL</B> will provide the BNFL team with expertise in the design of the 
highly advanced instrumentation and robotics technologies, as well as 
proven major nuclear engineering and project management experience.</LI>
     <LI><B>RMRS</B>, the waste manager at the Rocky Flats Site in Colorado, will 
support the BNFL team in bringing an unequaled knowledge of the waste 
characteristics -- the majority of the waste emanates from Rocky Flats -- 
as well as expertise in the areas of mixed waste treatment, storage, and 
disposal operations.  RMRS is jointly owned by MK and BNFL.</LI>
     <LI>Team members that will provide specialty technologies include:  <B>GTS 
Duratek</B>, selected for its unparalleled experience in commercial scale, 
radioactive waste vitrification; <B>MSC</B>, chosen for its unique, large-scale 
specialty metal melting and recycling capabilities; and <B>PSC</B>, which     
represents the leading edge in proven and unique waste characterization 
systems.</LI>

<p>MK ANNOUNCED 3RD QUARTER RESULTS
</b></center>
<P>
BOISE -- Washington Construction Group, Inc., renamed Morrison Knudsen 
Corporation following its merger with MK, announced today its third 
quarter results for the period ended August 31, 1996. Morrison Knudsen 
Corporation and Washington Construction Group, Inc. merged on
September 11, 1996 and the results announced today are for the former 
Washington Construction Group only for the quarterly period ending prior 
to the merger.  <P>
     The Company announced that the recognition of after-tax adjustments 
of $11.1 million for write-downs on certain real estate properties and 
non-core businesses held for sale have resulted in a net loss of $11.2 
million, $.38 per share, on revenue of $97.8 million for the quarter ended 
August 31, 1996 compared to net income of $3.0 million, $.10 per share, on 
revenue of $71.9 million for the third quarter of 1995. The net loss for 
the nine month period ended August 31, 1996 was $10.4 million, $.35 per 
share, on revenue of $242.4 million compared to net income of $5.2 
million, $.18 per share, on revenue of $160.3 million for the comparable 
period in 1995.  Gross profit of the former Washington Construction Group 
for the third quarter was $5.0 million, compared to $7.2 million for
the third quarter of 1995. <P>
     The Company said that it has completed a review of financial matters 
following the merger which included changing the status of certain assets 
from "held for use" in the business to "held for sale". These assets 
include a non-core business and a real estate development project. In 
assessing the carrying amount of these properties, the Company recognized 
an after-tax impairment loss totaling $7.5 million.<P>
     "Selling these non-core assets is part of our strategy to streamline 
operations and focus on our core engineering and construction operations," 
said Robert A. Tinstman, MK President and Chief Executive Officer. "The 
merger provided an opportunity to evaluate the status of these 
non-construction related assets, which were primarily real estate 
development projects. The write-downs will not have an impact on future 
results and we remain confident in the future performance of the
combined Company's operating units."<P>
     In connection with the merger, the Company plans to consolidate 
certain functions of the combined company and relocate personnel to its 
Boise headquarters. Doing so will change the manner and extent to which 
certain offices will be used in the future. In assessing the carrying 
amount of such property, the Company recognized an after-tax impairment

exercise being payable to the holders of such secured debt.<p>

MK - WASHINGTON CONSTRUCTION MERGER APPROVED</B>
</CENTER><P>
Boise -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that the company's plan 
of reorganization was approved by Judge Peter Walsh of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, District of Delaware. The plan calls for the merger of Morrison 
Knudsen and Washington Construction Group, Inc. and an exchange of MK's 
approximately $360 million in secured debt and contingent liabilities
for new equity in the company and other assets.  The plan received the 
unanimous approval of MK's secured creditors and was supported by 90% of 
the shareholders who responded to the solicitation.<P>
     The company also announced that it has reached agreement with Bank of 
Montreal, as agent, for a $200 million credit facility with a five year 
term.  MK has also reached agreement on a bonding arrangement with a 
surety syndicate led by Federal Insurance Company, The St. Paul Surety  
and American Home Insurance Group (AIG) which provides complete bonding 
support to meet MK's business objectives. <P>
     After the merger, Morrison Knudsen will be essentially debt free, 
with bonding capacity as required, a net worth of more than $300 million 
and an established $200 million line of credit.  MK's core engineering & 
construction, heavy civil construction, environmental and mining groups 
will have revenue approaching $2 billion annually and a backlog of $4 
billion. The combined company has 10,000 employees at work throughout the 
United States and in 25 countries. The merger will be effective on 
September 11, 1996.<P>
     "The MK-Washington merger combines the strength of two great 
companies. Washington Construction's financial strength, bonding capacity 
and operating expertise in heavy construction and contract mining are a 
perfect fit with Morrison Knudsen's Heavy Construction and Mining Groups,
and complements MK's design, engineering and construction capabilities in 
the industrial process, power and environmental markets, " said Robert A. 
Tinstman, MK's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We emerge as a 
company with operational focus, financial strength and proven management. 
All of our clients -- 100% of them -- stayed with MK during our recent 
challenges and our 10,000 employees have consistently rewarded that 
loyalty by providing the best engineering and construction expertise in 
the world."<P>
     	<B><CENTER>Board of Directors</CENTER></B><P>

     Following the merger of the two companies, Dennis R. Washington will 
serve as Chairman of the Board and Robert A. Tinstman will serve as 
President and Chief Executive Officer.  The newly merged company will be 
named Morrison Knudsen Corporation and be headquartered in Boise, Idaho.  
The companies also announced that Robert S. Miller and Dorn Parkinson have 
each been designated to serve as Vice Chairman of the Board. <P>

MK PROJECT WINS 1996 OUTSTANDING CIVIL ENGINEERING AWARD<p>

</b></center>
	BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that the American Society of Civil
Engineers has named Boston's Ted Williams Tunnel the Outstanding Civil Engineering
Achievement for 1996.   The 3,840 foot-long underwater tunnel is the first major component of the
$7.8 billion Central Artery / Third Harbor Tunnel Project and was placed on the floor of the Boston
Harbor by an MK-led joint venture including Interbeton, Inc. and J.F. White Contracting Company.<p>

	The new four-lane tunnel is an immersed marine tube comprised of 12 sections, each 320 feet long,
80 feet wide and 40 feet high and links South Boston to Logan International Airport.   MK served
as the primary construction contractor for the project and was responsible for placing the tube
sections in water up to 100 feet deep.   Work on the $250-million tunnel began in 1993 and was
completed on schedule in 1995. <p>

	"The success of this project reflects MK's operational excellence in marine construction,"  said
Robert A. Tinstman, MK President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Heavy Construction Group
has a rich heritage in completing challenging underwater work.  Marine construction, as one of our
core operational strengths, will continue to be important in the future."  <p>

	In 1993, MK's emergency repair work on an ocean outfall pipeline off  the coast of San Diego won
the company the Contractor of the Year Award.  MK repaired the ruptured outfall, which extends
two miles into the Pacific Ocean, in 56 days.<p>

	The 33,000 ton sections of the Ted Williams Tunnel were fabricated at Bethlehem Steel's Baltimore
shipyard and barged 560 miles to Boston where  MK placed the tubes on the harbor floor within 1
inch tolerances, using global positioning systems and underwater divers.<p>

	Morrison Knudsen Corporation, founded in 1912, serves the world's heavy construction,
environmental, industrial, mining, operations &amp; maintenance, power, process, and 
transportation markets as an engineer and constructor. <p>

Enhancements for this version include
additional function and programming language support, as well as
performance improvements.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Enhanced scalability using OS/390 workload management facility
</B><DD>This support allows the Internet Connection Secure Server to establish policies to
manage application workload.
Workload management modifies the server environment to achieve
the best overall results.
Increased server throughput is achieved by using the workload
management facility to spread the total server workloads among
several multi-threaded server processes, minimizing cross-thread
serialization and removing the hard ceiling on the total number
of threads that can be started by the server.
<P><DT><B>Customized response based on requesting browser
</B><DD>Your server can now automatically
detect the type of browser making a request and
return Web information that is
appropriately formatted for the particular browser.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Counter and date/time image support for Web pages
</B><DD>You can enhance your Web pages with
a user-access counter and the date and time as graphical images.
See the section on customizing your Web site in the
<CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Enhancements to logging and generating reports on server activity
</B><DD>This version offers
a new Java Graphical User Interface (GUI).
You can log and analyze activity on your server
based on URLs, host names, methods, or return codes.  You can generate
tailored reports based on associations such as URL hits by host, host
hits by URL, return codes by URL, and methods by URL.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>HTTP Version 1.1 compliance
</B><DD>Support for HTTP now includes HTTP 1.1 compliance, which
provides for persistent connections and virtual hosts.
Persistent connections allow the server to accept multiple requests
and to send responses over the same TCP/IP connection.  Virtual
hosts allow one IP address to serve multiple files instead
of requiring different IP addresses for different files.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Expanded Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support
</B><DD>CGI support now includes the Java programming language
in addition to the other languages already supported,
such as C, REXX, and Perl.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Year 2000 support
</B><DD>The Internet Connection Secure Server makes the transition into the 21st century a smooth
conversion with reliable support for the year 2000 and beyond.
<P><DT><B>Performance improvements
</B><DD>Dramatic improvements in single and multiple processor
environments coupled with significant CPU requirement reductions
provide higher throughput and shorter response time.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Web site content rating support
</B><DD>Based on the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS),
you can use an independent rating service to rate the content of
documents served through your Web site, or you can act as a rating
service for your own or other Web sites.
Users who request the ratings can then
evaluate the Web pages for acceptable content before viewing them.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Client authentication and other enhancements to SSL support
</B><DD>The vast majority of users are choosing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) protocol for their secure transactions instead of S-HTTP, so
SSL is where we're putting our efforts as well.  We've removed S-HTTP
support in this and future versions of the Internet Connection Secure Server, and we will continue
to enhance our support of SSL.  Our support of SSL V3 now includes
client authentication, which is a security enhancement that
allows the server to verify, with a high degree of
confidence, that any client is who it says it is.  Our support of
SSL V3 also includes server authentication, data encryption, and
additional Message Digest Hashing algorithms.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>SOCKS support and SSL tunneling
</B><DD>Clients can now connect directly to a SOCKS server, instead of
using an interim server, which lowers response time.  SSL tunneling
allows the server to act as a proxy server for secure transactions.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Online access to server performance and status information
</B><DD>
Through your browser,
you can use the Server Activity Monitor to
observe performance and status information about your server and
the network.
Access log entries are also displayed.
See the section on managing your server in the
<CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Internet Connection Application Program Interface (ICAPI) support
</B><DD>Improvements include expanded diagnostic capability with additional
trace capability and additional messages.  Users may use
existing HTTP methods or tailor them to their needs.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Java servlet support
</B><DD>Java 1.0 support provides Sun Microsystems, Inc., standards
for servlets.  Servlets typically offer significant performance
enhancements over CGI programs.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Proxy authentication
</B><DD>You can set up password protection for your
proxy server independently
of the password protection at the destination server.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Book title change
</B><DD>Our <CITE>Up and Running</CITE> books of previous releases have
been renamed <CITE>Quick Beginnings</CITE>.  The focus remains the
same:  to provide the minimal, essential information for planning for,
installing, and starting to use your server as quickly and easily
as possible.
<P><DT><B>Year 2000 support
</B><DD>The Internet Connection Secure Server smooths the transition into
the 21st century with reliable support for the year 2000 and beyond.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRMOREAB" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_6">Chapter 2. More about your server</A></H1>
<P>
The IBM Internet Connection Secure Server
provides the foundation for building your
company's presence on the Internet.
Your business can use the Internet Connection Secure Server on the World
Wide Web to reach customers and suppliers around the world.
Or you can use the Internet Connection Secure Server
within your business to communicate with employees.
<P>
With the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server, your business can implement
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
to ensure that your business transactions are secure.
<P>
This chapter describes some of the key features of the server.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_7" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_7">Installing and configuring the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can easily install the server using the
OS/2 installation tool, Software Installer.
<P>
After you install the server, you can start it using the
configuration values you specified during installation.
Default values are supplied for all the other configuration values.
Using a Web browser, you can then connect to the server.
<P>
Once you connect to your server, you'll see the Front Page, which it
uses as its home page.
The Front Page provides a valuable assortment of
tools and information, including links to:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Configuration and Administration Forms
<LI>Sample Home Page
<LI>Internet Connection Family Web Site
<LI>Documentation
</UL>
For installation steps, see <A HREF="icsur006.html#HDRINS">Chapter 4. "Installing your server"</A>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_8" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_8">Using other programs with the server</A></H2>
<P>
The server supports the Common Gateway Interface (CGI),
which allows you to create external programs (CGI programs)
that interface with your server
and perform tasks such as searching and forwarding e-mail messages.
<P>
To assist you in writing CGI programs, the server
includes utilities for extracting forms data, writing
document headers, and processing image maps.
<P>The server also supports the Internet Connection
Application Programming Interface (ICAPI).
This interface is designed specifically for the server's
threaded processing and allows you to easily extend the server's
base functions.
Using the ICAPI you can write extensions to perform
site-specific processing, such as publishing customized
pages based on client's code level, enhancing the basic
authentication, and adding error routines to track problems
or alert you about serious conditions.
<P>
For more information, see the <CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>
and the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_9" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_9">Managing your server with Simple Network Management Protocol</A></H2>
<P>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subagent built
into Internet Connection Secure Server maintains server information and performance data
in an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB).
The MIB data describes the server being managed, reflects current
and recent server status, and provides server performance data.
From any SNMP-capable network manager, you can display, monitor,
and adjust thresholds for your server's performance to proactively
tune or fix server problems before they become server outages.
<P>
For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_10" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_10">Restricting access</A></H2>
<P>
Most likely, you will not want everyone to be able to access
all the information on your server.
For example, you probably would not want everyone to be able to
access your CGI programs.
<P>
You can restrict access based on user name and
password, or the address of the requester.
Access authorization is controlled using the configuration file and
possibly one or more other files, including:
<UL>
<P><LI>A protection setup, which defines the protection being used
<P><LI>A password file, which allows you to define user names and
passwords
<P><LI>A group file, which allows you to define groups of user names
<P><LI>An Access Control List (ACL) file, which allows you to define access
for individual files or groups of files on a protected directory
</UL>
For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_11" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_11">Mapping resources</A></H2>
<P>
You can create a virtual hierarchy of Web resources.
As part of the server's configuration, you can specify
resource mapping rules, which associate a request template
with the actual path to a document or resource.
Each request that comes to the server is checked against
these rules to determine if the request should be accepted
and where the requested resource is actually located.

<H2><A NAME="Header_12" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_12">Logging requests and errors</A></H2>
<P>
To help you determine whether or not your Internet message
is reaching the intended audience, you can keep <B><I>access logs</I></B>
that show who is accessing your server and when.
To see internal server errors, you can check your server's
<B><I>error logs</I></B>.
If your server is a caching proxy,
you can keep logs of requests
for cached files in a <B><I>cache access log</I></B>.
<P>
In addition, your server creates <B><I>agent logs</I></B>,
<B><I>referer logs</I></B>, and <B><I>CGI error logs</I></B>.
Agent logs
indicate which Web browser was used to access a Web page.
Referer logs indicate the page that linked to or referred to the page.
CGI error logs contain standard error output (stderr) from CGI
programs.
<P>
You can control what gets logged by filtering out entries
that match a particular pattern.
Your server automatically creates a report for each log,
so you can view the contents of the log.
You can modify these default report templates so that you include
and/or exclude log entries contained in the report.
<P>
Because the logs are written in a format that is common to most Web
servers, you can use any of several generic statistical programs to
analyze the log contents.
<P>
You can compress log data,
archive reports, and include old
log data in reports.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_13" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_13">Running the server as a caching proxy</A></H2>
<P>
When you configure your server as a caching proxy server,
you can improve performance, as well as allow users
of your internal network to access documents on the Internet.
<P>
You can specify many configuration options
for a caching proxy, including:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Which files you want (and do not want) to store in cache
<LI>The maximum amount of space allotted to cache storage
<LI>Automatic reclamation of cache storage space
<LI>Routing of requests to other proxy servers
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_14" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_14">Running the server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts</A></H2>
<P>
You can configure your server to serve different files based on
the IP address of the network connection a request comes in on
or the host for whom a request is made.
This is particularly valuable to Internet service
providers who want to use one server to provide Web sites for
multiple customers.
The server allows you to configure:
<UL>
<P><LI>Welcome Pages: to determine
how the server responds to requests that do not contain a file name
<P><LI>Mapping Rules: to set map requests to physical files
and to determine whether the server processes a request
<P><LI>Access Control: to activate different protection rules for
requests depending on which address the request comes in on or
which host name is specified in a URL
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_15" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_15">Using server-side includes</A></H2>
<P>Server-side includes enable the server to do some processing
of Web pages before the page is sent to the client.
The current date, the size of the file, the last change of a file are
examples of the kind of information that can be sent to the client.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_16" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_16">Customizing the server's error messages</A></H2>
<P>The Internet Connection Secure Server design is based on the work at CERN.
You can customize basic CERN messages that your server
sends back to the client when error conditions are encountered.
For example, you can change a message
to include more information about the cause of the
problem and suggest possible solutions to fix it.
For internal networks, you might provide
a contact person for your users to call.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_17" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_17">Adding a search facility to your Web site</A></H2>
<P>
The Internet Connection Secure Server includes the NetQuestion search facility in a package that
you can install separately.
NetQuestion enables
you to build and maintain searchable indexes to the information on
your Web site.  NetQuestion includes a search engine, a command
interface, and HTML forms that aid Web site navigation and
administration.
<P>
For more information, see the documentation that comes with
the NetQuestion package.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_18" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_18">Using proxy authentication</A></H2>
The server distinguishes
between authorized user IDs and passwords that are used
by the end-point server and the proxy server.  This allows
you to require authentication for proxy requests.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.

<H3><A NAME="Header_28" HREF="#PToC_28">Imbeds directive</A></H3>
<P>
In Version 4 Release 2,
the imbeds directive is required for server-side includes.
In previous releases,
you could specify that documents with
a specific extension or suffix be processed for server-side includes.
If you specified an extension or suffix of .html or .htm,
you do not need to make any changes to your configuration file.
If you specified any other extension or suffix, you need to check
the AddType directives and make sure you have an AddType defined
for that suffix that has a content type of text/x-ssi-html.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for information about
this directive.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_29" HREF="#PToC_29">Proxy server and caching proxy server</A></H3>
<P>
The Configuration and Administration forms for defining proxy and
caching proxy settings have been rearranged and changed slightly.
Two forms have been deleted and the information from them has
been added to the other proxy forms.
<P>
These forms have been deleted:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Time Limit for Cached Files
<LI>Cache File Expiration
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the CacheTimeMargin directive has been deleted.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for information about configuring
your server as a proxy server or caching proxy server.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_30" HREF="#PToC_30">Proxy authentication</A></H3>
In Version 4 Release 1, the server did not distinguish
between a user ID and password used for authentication at the
proxy server and those used for authentication at the end-point server.
In Version 4 Release 2, request authentication is supported.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for information
about proxy authentication.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_31" HREF="#PToC_31">Server IP Address</A></H3>
<P>
Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longer
be specified for a server's IP address.
This applies to the following directives:
<UL>
<P><LI>imbeds
<P><LI>Welcome
<P><LI>DefProt
<P><LI>Protect
<P><LI>Exec
<P><LI>Fail
<P><LI>Map
<P><LI>Pass

</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_32" HREF="#PToC_32">CHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods for the Enable directive</A></H3>
<P>
Beginning with Version 4.2, the
CHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods are no longer supported.
You can use the PUT method for CHECKIN and the GET method for
CHECKOUT; however, the
Internet Connection Secure Server does not perform locking or versioning.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_33" HREF="#PToC_33">Accessory script directives</A></H3>
<P>The accessory script directives, DELETE-Script, POST-Script,

<H2><A NAME="HDRAUTOINS" HREF="#PToC_43">Automating installation</A></H2>
If you are installing the server from a remote code server,
you can use a Configuration, Installation, and Distribution
(CID) response file to automatically install or update the server.
This section describes how to perform the following two types of
automated installation:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Remote attended installation
<LI>Remote unattended installation
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_44" HREF="#PToC_44">Remote attended installation</A></H3>
<P>
If a remote code server has the server product files, the clients
of the code server can perform a remote attended installation.
Clients must meet the server hardware and software requirements,
have a LAN connection, and have access to the remote code server
directory that contains the server product files.
For more information on hardware and software requirements,
see <A HREF="icsur005.html#HDRPLN">Chapter 3. "Planning for installation"</A>.
<P>
The code server must have a server response file.
The response file contains pre-set values for the installation
variables.
The default response file for the server is named websrvr.rsp.
The default response file contains comments that explain the
different variables and how to set them.
<P>
From the client where you want to install the server,
follow these instructions for a remote attended installation:
<OL>
<P><LI>Verify that you have access to the remote code server and that
the server response file is in the same directory of the code server
as the product files.
<P><LI>At an OS/2 prompt, enter
<PRE>
   <VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR><B>install /r&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where:
<UL>
<P><LI><B><VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR></B> is the drive and path
where the server files reside on the code server.
<P><LI><B>/r&#58;</B>
indicates that the name of a response file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
is the name of the response file to be used.
You must give the full drive and path name
if it is different from the current directory.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><B>Note: </B>There are no spaces in the
<B>/r&#58;<VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR>websrvr.rsp</B> string.
<P><LI>As the installation process continues,
either use the pre-set values from the response file
or modify them to meet your own particular needs.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_45" HREF="#PToC_45">Remote unattended installation</A></H3>
<P>
<P>
You can use a software distribution manager to
perform remote unattended installations of the server.
Remote unattended installation allows you to distribute software
from a software distribution manager to workstations.
You must have a network connection established between the
software distribution manager and the target workstations.
The target workstations must have the client software for the
software distribution manager installed.
<P>
For remote unattended installation of the server using other
software distribution managers, use the install command as follows:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
   <B>install  /x  /r&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>  <B>/l1&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\error.log</VAR>  <B>/l2&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\history.log</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>/x</B> indicates unattended installation.
<P><LI><B>/r&#58;</B> indicates that the name
of a response file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
is the name of the response file to be used.
</UL>
<P><LI><B>/l1&#58;</B> indicates that the name of the error log
file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\error.log</VAR> is the name of the file
where the installation procedure should write error messages.
</UL>
<P><LI><B>/l2&#58;</B> indicates that the name of the history log
file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\history.log</VAR> is the name of the file
where the installation procedure should write information messages.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><B>Notes: </B><OL>
<P><LI>
There are no spaces between the parameter indicators (/r, /l1, and /l2)

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSTRSTO" HREF="#PToC_49">Starting the server</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes how to start and stop your server
after you have finished installing it.
If you think the server is running but you do not see the window
for it on your OS/2 Desktop, press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>
to see the list of active OS/2 programs.
If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double click
the entry to bring the server's window into view.
<P>
If you are running a non-secure server,
you will see the message
<TT>Security not available. <VAR>filename</VAR>.dll did not load</TT>.
This message lets you know that you are not running the Internet Connection Secure Server.
You do not need to do anything in response to the message.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_50" HREF="#PToC_50">Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder</A></H3>
<P>
If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,
the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.
Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.
If you rebooted your system after installing the server,
the server should be running now.
<P>
When you start the server automatically,
it uses the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_51" HREF="#PToC_51">Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon</A></H3>
<P>
The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Secure Server
folder on your OS/2 Desktop.
Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
To start the server, double click the icon.
<P>
The server starts with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_52" HREF="#PToC_52">Starting from the command prompt</A></H3>
<P>
You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>httpd</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This starts the server with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
The httpd command also accepts various options for changing
configuration settings at run time.
For details on the httpd command options,
see the <CITE>Webmaster&#39;s Guide</CITE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_53" HREF="#PToC_53">Starting multiple instances of the server</A></H3>
<P>
You can start multiple instances of the server,
but each instance must listen on a separate port.
All instances, other than the first, can be started
by entering the following command from a command prompt:
<P>
<B>httpd -r <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR></B>
<P>
where <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR> is a configuration file that
specifies the individual port.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_54" HREF="#PToC_54">Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window</A></H3>
<P>
You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Secure Server window
by selecting <B>Restart</B>
from the <B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
The server reloads the configuration settings from
the configuration file it was originally started with.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_55" HREF="#PToC_55">Stopping the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.
Do any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and double click
the small icon in the top left corner.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and select <B>Exit</B> from the
<B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and press <B>F3</B>.
<P><LI>Press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>.
With the right mouse button click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
Click <B>Close</B>.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRVIEWFP" HREF="#PToC_56">Viewing your server's Front Page</A></H2>
<P>
After your server is up and running, you can use WebExplorer or
any other Web browser to look at the server's Front Page.
<P>
If you started the server with the default configuration file
and you have not yet created your own home page,
you can view the Front Page by using your
browser to open the following URL:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>
</PRE>
<P>Where <VAR>your.server.name</VAR> is
the fully qualified name of your host.
For example, http://www.ibm.com/.
<P>
The server's Front Page contains the following links:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Configuration and Administration Forms</B>.  A tool that lets
you configure your server by filling in a set of forms.
The forms are coded with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
<P><LI><B>Sample Home Page</B>.  A sample document
that demonstrates how to use many of the HTML tags.
<P><LI><B>Internet Connection Family Web Site</B>.  From this Web
site, you can download beta versions of software under development,
product giveaways, accessory code, demo code, and other goodies.
You can also learn more about our retail products.
<P><LI><B>Documentation</B>.  An online HTML version of the following:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><CITE>Quick Beginnings</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web design information</CITE>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
If you want to go to the Front Page after you create your own home
page, just include the Front Page file name on the URL.
The Front Page file name is Frntpage.html,
so you would use the following URL to see it:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/Frntpage.html</B>
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRWHTNXT" HREF="#PToC_57">What's next?</A></H2>
<P>
Now that your server is up and running, you'll probably
want to configure it to your own specifications.
Your server allows you to:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Modify the Configuration and Administration forms</B>
to easily configure the default settings.
<P><LI><B>Change the default home page</B>
to have the server return your own home page.
The home page is the document that your server returns when a client
sends a request that does not point to a specific directory or file.
<P><LI><B>Change your document root directory</B>
to serve requests that do not point to a specific directory.
Your home page should always be on your home directory.
<P><LI><B>Run your server as a caching proxy</B> to improve
response time by having the proxy server store the documents
it receives from other servers in a local cache.
<P><LI><B>Run a proxy server and standard server</B>
from the same host to have the convenience of running
two different servers from one host.
<P><LI><B>Run your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual
hosts</B> to
serve different files based on the IP address of the network
connection a request comes in on or the host for whom the
request is made.
This is especially helpful for
Internet access providers who want to use one server to provide
Web sites for multiple customers.
</UL>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRCIDSYSL" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_66">Appendix A. Installing with SystemView</A></H1>
Installing with SystemView
<P>You can use SystemView to install the Internet Connection Server on
unattended workstations using the statements included in
two files called a <I>software profile</I> and a
<I>response file</I>.
A software profile is used by SystemView to
invoke an application installation program.
A response file is used by the installation program to get all of the
data it needs during the installation process.
<P>
Using SystemView, you specify the information for the software profile
and response files when you customize the application definition
file, which defines how to install and configure the Internet Connection Server.
This file is shipped with the Internet Connection Server.
<P>Refer to the SystemView documentation for a complete description
of software profiles and response files.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_67" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_67">Overview</A></H2>
<P>To install the Internet Connection Server on server workstations
using SystemView, you need to:
<UL>
<P><LI>Copy the Internet Connection Server files to the code server
<P><LI>Add the Internet Connection Server information to the SystemView software library
<P><LI>Configure the Internet Connection Server in the SystemView software library
by placing it into the catalog at the distribution server
<P><LI>Distribute and install the resulting software object
using SystemView on target server workstations
</UL>
<P>These tasks are described in the following sections.
If you need additional assistance to perform these
tasks, use the online help or refer to
<CITE>SystemView Up and Running&#33;</CITE> for more information.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_68" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_68">Copying the Internet Connection Server to the Code Server</A></H2>
<P>
To set up the code server so that you can install the Internet Connection Server
using SystemView, enter the XCOPY command.
<P>
For example, to copy the files from the CD-ROM located in the
E&#58; drive to the D&#58; drive, you would enter this command:
<PRE>
XCOPY E&#58;\*.* D&#58;\CID\IMG\WEB /S
</PRE>
<P>
This command copies the files from the root directory
on the CD-ROM in the E: drive to the D: drive,
putting the files under the directory \CID\IMG\WEB.
<P>
The /S indicates that all of the subdirectories and their contents
and the contents of the root directory should be copied.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_69" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_69">Adding the Internet Connection Server to the Software Library</A></H2>
<P>
To add the Internet Connection Server to the software library, do the following steps:
<UL>
<P><LI>Start SystemView.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>SystemView Service Manager</B> icon.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>CID Software Preparation</B> icon.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>Software Library</B> icon.
<P><LI>Select <B>Software</B> from the menu bar
on the Software Library window.
<P><LI>Select <B>New&#46;&#46;&#46;</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Find...</B>.
<P><LI>In the Find definition file window, select:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The drive letter, where the CD-ROM is located,
in the <B>Drive</B> list
<LI>\ in the <B>Directory</B> list
<LI>www.adf in the <B>File</B> list
</UL>
<P>
This copies the remote installation files (.ADF, .VAR, and .MRF)
from the CD-ROM to the subdirectory where SystemView resides (\SWLIB).
<P><LI>Select <B>Add</B> to associate the application
definition file with the Internet Connection Server.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCONFSR" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_70">Configuring the Internet Connection Server</A></H2>
<P>To configure the Internet Connection Server, do the following steps:
<UL>
<P><LI>Double-click on the Internet Connection Server icon in the Software Library window.
<P><LI>Select <B>Configuration</B> from the menu bar on the
Software Configuration window and then select
<B>New&#46;&#46;&#46;</B> from the pull-down window.
</UL>
<P>
The Settings notebook is displayed.
You need to define how the Internet Connection Server will be installed
on the target server workstation.
<P>On each page of the notebook,
select each of the items in the <B>Variables</B>
list and choose the setting.
A description of each variable is displayed in the
<B>Explanation</B> field of the notebook page.
When you have completed all of the pages of the notebook,
click on <B>OK</B>.
If you are ready to distribute the Internet Connection Server, select <B>Yes</B>
when asked <B>Do you want to catalog the database?</B>.
<P>
Here is an overview of just a few of the pages you will fill in.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Configuration Page
</B><DD>
Use to define both an identifier needed to catalog
the Internet Connection Server uniquely and a name that is a short description
for the configuration you are creating.
For example, the identifier may be <TT>EUROSERV</TT>
and the name may be <TT>Definition for the servers in Europe</TT>.
<P><DT><B>Code Server Page
</B><DD>
Use to associate the configuration with the redirection
mechanism to be used during CID installation.
Define the code server aliases and the CID directory
aliases that let the target workstation (where you want to
install the Internet Connection Server) access the code server images.
You also indicate whether an existing or new response
file will be used.
<P><DT><B>Response File Page
</B><DD>
Use to specify the name and directory where the existing
response file is located.
</DL>
<P>The remaining pages of the Settings notebook configure
the Internet Connection Server at the target server workstation.  SystemView uses
the information from the notebook to create the settings
for the Internet Connection Server variables in the response file.
Refer to the comments in the response file itself
(websrvr.rsp.) for more information about response file keywords.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_71" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_71">Installing the Internet Connection Server on a Remote Server Workstation</A></H2>
<P>
To install the Internet Connection Server on a workstation, you can either use
the Event Scheduler or the Remote System Manager.
Refer to
<CITE>SystemView Up and Running&#33;</CITE> for
information on how to use the Event Scheduler
and the Remote System Manager.
This book also contains information about changing
variables at installation time.
