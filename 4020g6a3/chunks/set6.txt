MEDICUS administrators, Managed Care Consultants Ltd., negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical location.
<p>
MEDICUS administrators, Managed Care Consultants Ltd., negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical suitability. A MEDICUS client will normally be within easy reach of a Preferred Hospital. This pricing co-operation from the hospitals concerned greatly assists in controlling premium levels.
<p>
Under normal circumstances a client will attend one of these "Preferred Hospitals", which number over 100 but this will not be mandatory if the client has genuine medical reasons for needing to attend another hospital not on our list, providing that authorisation has been obtained from Managed Care Consultants Ltd. Apart from reducing premium levels, the use of Preferred Hospitals allows our client the benefit of direct billing and the assurance of quality accommodation and medical services. 
<p>
The use of Preferred Hospitals ensures our clients receive both the highest levels of comfort associated with private care, together with access to specialised medical centres when medical circumstances make this necessary. It enables us to give our clients better value for money today and help to control costs in the future.
<p>
<i>This system also allows access, without inpatient limits, 
to any hospital in the country on the basis of medical necessity.</i>

<h3><b>PRE-EXISTING AND CONGENITAL CONDITIONS</H3></B>
<p>
Medicus particularly wishes to draw attention to the clause in its rules relating to Pre-existing and Congenital conditions. <P>
Medicus will cover Pre-existing conditions ( as defined, below ) provided that your child remains free of treatment, medication or advice for a period of two years from the commencement date of your Child Care Plan. If the condition recurs during this initial two year period, then the exclusion will continue until two years have elapsed since the last treatment, medication or advice for that condition. Congenital conditions are not covered under Medicus Child Care.
<p>
<br>
<i>A Pre � existing condition is a condition which is in existence at the commencement date (even if the condition has been misdiagnosed or if an inaccurate diagnosis has not been made by a qualified medical practitioner ) or for which you have received treatment, medication or advice on some previous occasions.</i>
<br>
<h3><b>PREFERRED HOSPITALS</H3></B>
<P>
Medicus administrators negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the UK. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the high quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical suitability. A Medicus client will normally be within easy reach of a Preferred Hospital. This pricing co-operation form the hospital concerned greatly assists in controlling premium levels.
Under normal circumstances a client will attend one of these Preferred Hospitals but this will not be mandatory if the client has genuine medical reasons for needing to attend another hospital not on the list, providing that authorisation has been obtained from your counsellor. Apart from reducing premium levels, the use of Preferred Hospitals allows our client the benefit of direct billing and the assurance of quality accommodation and medical services. 
<br>
<i>The use of Preferred Hospitals ensures our clients receive both the highest levels of comfort associated with private care, together with access to specialised medical centres when medical circumstances make this necessary.</i>

<A NAME="Encounter"></A>
<H3>What�s a close encounter with an EP really like?</H3>
<UL>
Like all great communicators, EPs engage people with warm, entertaining personalities.  And their "high-touch" style goes way beyond the limitations of passive electronic mediums so audiences have a truly unforgettable encounter:
<UL>
<img align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" src="../picture/conversation2.JPEG">
	<P><STRONG>100% interactive</STRONG> - EP robots respond instantly and often spontaneously.  They may be cute, humorous, clever, serious or loving, but they always get their message across.<BR>
	<P><STRONG>100% mobile</STRONG> - These robots are fast and they perform on any smooth, hard surface.  They move through doors and crowds with absolute precision, allowing them to go from location to location quickly.  This means that a single EP can cover a large area with ease.  EPs can also travel to multiple show locations in a single day using a custom van.<BR>
	<P><STRONG>EPs speak your language</STRONG> - Whatever it is!  Custom scripting and program preparation lets our clients use EPs to interact with any audience: young or old, in any language, from any cultural background.<BR>
	<P><STRONG>The ultimate software</STRONG> - They say clothes make the man.  We apply that to robots.  All EPs have soft fabric accessories like hands, hats and upholstered "laps" (to sit on for photos!).  Even the youngest kids have fun shaking hands and getting hugs from EPs.<BR>
	<P><STRONG>A close encounter of the best kind</STRONG> - Meeting an EP is magical and memorable.  We hope you�ll have the opportunity soon!<BR>
</UL></UL>

<A NAME="HighTech"></A>
<H3>What are some of their "high tech" features?</H3> 
<table width="400">
<tr><td>
<img alt="ROBOMEDIA" border="0" src="../image/robomedia_name.GIF"><img alt="robot running animation" border="0" src="../image/bluebot_run_ani.GIF"><img alt="ROBOMEDIA" border="0" src="../image/robomedia_name.GIF"></td></tr></table>

<UL>
These babies are loaded with options to give them robotic charm and help them interact and communicate with humans:
<UL>
	<P><STRONG>Design</STRONG> - Colorful and complex geometric shapes, flashing lights and plenty of visible electronic components satisfy even the most hard-core Popular Mechanics reader.

	<P><STRONG>Powerful sound systems</STRONG> -  EPs bring their own on-board mobile sound system that adjusts for any venue.  So, if an EP is teaching a group of 250 excited children in a school gym, leading a group of visitors through a science museum, entertaining shoppers in a mall or promoting products at a trade show, the audience hears the message loud and clear.

	<P><STRONG>Digital music & sound effects</STRONG> - EPs are equipped with 200 watt sound systems, which is usually plenty (and we would be happy to build one with "More power!" for you Home Improvement fans).  In addition to digital quality, the systems also offer digital flexibility so EPs can quickly add new music and effects for special presentations.
	<P><STRONG>Printed material dispenser</STRONG> - EPs distribute coupons, stickers, pamphlets and just about any type of flat printed material.  Also, they can distribute multiple types of materials at the same time, for example a sticker to a child and a brochure to the parent.
<img align="right" border="1" src="../picture/tech_led.JPEG">
	<P><STRONG>Programmable L.E.D. display</STRONG> - Everyone likes to see their name in lights.  This bright LED display is how EPs convey written information.
	<P><STRONG>Fine Corinthian Leather</STRONG> - Coming in �97.
	<P><STRONG>100% Mechanical Warranty</STRONG> - This feature may sound funny, unless you ever bought another robot for your company.  We learned to build our robots to deliver reliable service at every performance, year after year.  If we didn�t, we couldn�t make this guarantee.<BR>

</UL></UL>

<A NAME="CommTools"></A>
<H3>Why are EP robots terrific communication tools?</H3> 
<UL><P>
<img border="2" align="right" width="95" height="60" src="../image/bot_pic_ani.GIF">
Because they use the most powerful communication methods possible. EPs convey information using verbal, visual, auditory, written, kinetic, and kinesthetic techniques.  All of which are entirely interactive from the EP platform.
<P>
This multimedia versatility makes these robots outstanding for education, marketing and entertainment.  Other key points are:
<UL>
	<P><STRONG>Unique medium</STRONG> - How do you break through the information clutter to deliver your message?  Teachers, corporations, museums and the media all face the challenge of delivering their messages in a highly competitive environment.  EPs deliver information in an interactive way that�s entirely new and a way that people remember.
	<P><STRONG>Unlimited language capability</STRONG> -  Like a television or computer, EPs are a communications medium that let�s you deliver your message in any language and directed to any type of audience.  Our clients decide the EP�s script, jargon, language and message.
	<P><STRONG>Unlimited cultural appeal</STRONG> - One thing we�ve discovered in using robots is that they appeal to all types of people.  They aren�t from any specific ethnic group so they appeal to all of them.  People actually project their own cultural roots onto the robot making EPs  true ambassadors of good will that can cross any cultural boundary.

</UL></UL>

<A NAME="Stars"></A>
<H3>Who are some EP "Stars" I might recognize?</H3>
<UL>
We�ve promised all our robots their own personal home pages, causing a lot of commotion in our shop. But, such frivolities will take time.  While 
we�re waiting for them to make up improbable stories about themselves and have professional portraits taken and retouched, our founding robot has taken a few moments to put some facts together:<BR>

<A NAME="GetOne"></A>
<H3>Who builds EPs (and how do I get my hands on one)?</H3>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../graphics/whatar_c.gif">
<UL>
	<P><A HREF="../gk/index.htm">GoWell & Kent Inc.</A> (G&K) invented and built the first Electronic Personalities (EPs) in 1979.  Since then, they�ve specialized in using EPs to interact with humans on behalf of their clients worldwide.
	<P>With 17 years experience, G&K can create an EP that embodies your special themes, colors, logos, and features.  Most important, G&K offers turn-key presentations as well as turn-key installations that include training and service.  Whichever style you choose, they�ll help you use your robot communicator most effectively.
	<P>Hiring an EP is easier and a lot less expensive than you might think.  EP services are available for short presentations, for long term campaigns and for permanent installations.  Each type of EP use has a variety of cost options to meet your objectives and budget.  Please <A HREF="../contact.htm">contact GoWell & Kent</A> for details.

<H3>Little Known Foobie Facts</H3>



<UL>

<P><STRONG>1979</STRONG> - FUBAR first appeared at Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes Barre, PA. on February 17, 1979.  He claimed to have come to Earth from the planet Cragzot in the star system of Betelgeuse where he allegedly "built himself".  His story is unconfirmed to this day.



<P><STRONG>1979</STRONG> - In December, FUBAR aka Foobie became the first robotic Presidential Candidate when he held a press conference at the National Press Building in Washington DC.  AP and UPI wire stories were published by newspapers around the world.  FUBAR mysteriously withdrew from the race in early November 1980. FUBAR stated he was "leaving the race to the other three robots", not to mention leaving millions of voters undecided on the eve of the election.



<P><STRONG>1980</STRONG> - On July 14, FUBAR D. Robot became the first and only robot to gain membership in AFTRA (the American Federation of Television and Radio Actors).  To our knowledge, no other robot has received this honor to this day. Note: Other robots like C3PO and R2D2 are not union members - only the human actors that operate them are!



<P><STRONG>1983-84</STRONG> - FUBAR signs an exclusive contract with the William Morris Agency to appear on NBC�s hit sitcom, Silver Spoons, with Ricky Schroeder.  



<P><STRONG>1983</STRONG> - A year of scandal for FUBAR in Hollywood.  In June, the National Enquirer runs a photo of him with Hugh Hefner�s former wife Barbie Benton on his knee.  That same week, Star runs a photo of him with Donna Mills on his knee.   Shortly thereafter, Brandon Tartikoff directs FUBAR to officially change his name to Foobie following a short lesson in Archaic Military Acronyms from a friend.



<P><STRONG>1985</STRONG> - Foobie left his acting career to devote his efforts to the field of education and public service.  He continues his work today,  constantly making personal appearances throughout the US.

<UL><UL><STRONG>
	More powerful consumer impressions<BR>
	More memorable special events<BR>

<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H3>A quick robotic review</H3>
<UL>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../graphics/corp_3.jpg"></CENTER>
<P><UL>
Since 1979, <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personalities</A> or EP robots have fascinated Europeans and North Americans with live performances.  Their intriguing combination of "high tech" robotic looks and "high touch" interactive personalities holds proven appeal for all types of audiences and all age groups.<BR>
<P>
EP robots have made millions of direct consumer marketing contacts.  They�ve also produced millions of dollars worth of positive media coverage for corporate sponsors. <BR>
<P>
Customized robot mascots are a unique medium to promote a corporation�s image and message to the public.  This page is about corporate marketing and public relations campaigns that use robots.  You can also visit a separate site about <A HREF="../eom/meetings.htm">how robots energize meetings, company events, tradeshows, family days and parties.</A><BR>
</UL></UL>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
<A NAME="What"></A>
<H3>What type of robot program is most effective?</H3>
<UL>
<P>
The most effective format we�ve found to get corporate marketing and PR results is <STRONG>Educational Outreach Marketing</STRONG> or EOM.  <BR>

<P><STRONG>EOM format benefits include:</STRONG><P>
<UL><UL>
	<LI>High corporate visibility <BR>
	<LI>Unforgettable contacts with children, families, government officials and the media.<BR>
	<LI>Economical - adaptable to different budgets<BR>
	<LI>Highly mobile - adaptable to different markets<BR>
	<LI>Easily targeted to specific areas and demographics<BR>
	<LI>Immediate, measurable consumer and media feedback<BR>
	<LI>Unique program that competitors can�t copy<BR>
	<LI>Enhanced community image and interaction<BR>
</UL></UL>
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="How"></A>
<H3>How do robot outreach programs work?</H3>
<UL>
<P><STRONG>EOM</STRONG> programs use three components customized to a company's specific marketing and PR objectives:<BR>
<P><UL><OL>
	<LI><STRONG>Sponsor relevant educational message:</STRONG><BR>
Custom programs and materials include information about health, home safety, environmental issues, or other important topics the sponsor chooses.<P>
	<LI><STRONG>Custom corporate mascot robots:</STRONG><BR>
These unique corporate representatives deliver entertaining interactive presentations throughout any target market area.<P>
	<LI><STRONG>Community service format:</STRONG><BR>
Giving educational robot presentations to appropriate groups is what makes EOM work well.  Corporations gain visibility and direct consumer contacts while providing a valuable community service.<BR>
</OL></UL></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="Where"></A>
<H3>Where do corporations use robotic representatives?</H3>
<UL>
<P>
A company's marketing objectives and format determine the most effective final venues.  Sites already hosting robotic outreach presentations for companies include:<P>
<UL><UL><STRONG>
	<LI>Community events<BR>
	<LI>Convention centers<BR>
	<LI>Museums<BR>
	<LI>Local television and radio studios<BR>
	<LI>Public & private elementary schools<BR>
	<LI>Shopping malls and retail locations<BR>
	<LI>Universities and colleges<BR>
</STRONG></UL></UL>
</UL>

<P><H3>What corporations use robots successfully?</H3>
<P><UL>
Although robotic media is still in its infancy, it has attracted many well known <A HREF="corp_lst.htm">corporate clients.</A> <BR>
<P>CNN, Good Morning America and The Today Show, local newcasts and newspapers around the world have all featured corporate robot programs.<BR>
<P>For more details, please read a few multi-million dollar <A HREF="corp_cl.htm">robot marketing examples.</A>  These stories show how three major companies used robots to get serious PR and marketing results.<BR>

<H2>Example 1</H2>

<H3>Targeting Consumers with Robotic Outreach</H3>



<P>

<STRONG>Challenge:</STRONG> In 1986, this multi-billion dollar private company was the largest service provider of it�s type in the world. Then, a major industry journal published a study showing that while the company excelled in a number of important areas, it had virtually no image of community service. The client was especially concerned with positive public recognition at that time as they were about to go public and the owners were trying to pre-sell blocks of stock to institutional investors.



<P>

The company had 72 regional locations representing nearly 1000 retail outlets in 19 states.  They needed a PR program that would work well from coast to coast.  To save costs, the program also had to give each of their regional administrators the tools and skills needed to mount their own local media, public relations and government outreach campaigns.



<P>

<STRONG>Experience:</STRONG> The client hired G&K to design and implement a series of national and local marketing programs over a 9 year period.  The <A HREF="../working.htm">Educational Outreach Marketing</A> <!-- link to EOM page --> segment of the program ran from 1988 to 1992 and provides an excellent example of multiple location promotion with robots. 



<P>

<STRONG>Results:</STRONG> The client set clear objectives . . . and exceeded them! In the program�s first year, the client donated educational programs to targeted local schools taught by their robot mascots. By the program�s conclusion, more than 1,000,000 children and their families had direct contact with the client�s custom robotic mascots and promotional materials. Their generous support of local education was amply rewarded.



<P>

The client�s ad agency media counts showed that the robot mascot was a magnet for positive media coverage. The media return alone exceeded the client�s first year program costs by 2 to 1. CNN gave the client international coverage with a 3 1/2 minute spot that ran 24 times.  The spot identified the client and prominently featured their custom robot mascot. Their mascot also appeared on the Today Show and in hundreds of local media spots. All told, the client�s positive media coverage nationwide was worth more than $2,000,000, much of it in front page feature articles.



<P>

Principals, teachers, parents and children sent the client more than 30,000 personal letters of appreciation. Perhaps more significant were the letters of praise sent by Senators, Congressional Representatives, Governors and Mayors. State proclamations applauding the client�s contributions were passed in California, Maryland, Texas and Florida, followed by dozens of city proclamations.  The client�s most distinguished recognition came from President Bush in the program�s third year.  At a special White House ceremony, the program was presented a Presidential Award for Private Sector Initiatives. 



<P>

And there were enormous results within their own field. In 1990, the client�s community service program got them a standing ovation from peers at the industry�s annual conference. They went on to win the highest professional award in their industry for Marketing Excellence.  The client finally retired their award winning EOM program after their successful public stock offering in 1992.

<H2>Example 2</H2>

<H3>Insuring Success with Robot Teachers</H3>



<P>

<STRONG>Challenge:</STRONG> Regional health care insurance providers were seeking a community relations program to increase local media visibility and provide networking opportunities with government leaders and parents. The strategy had to be unique to set their plans apart from area health care providers that were competing for the same customers.



<P>

The plans also wanted the option to have different levels of program involvement, from considerable local staff participation to having a turnkey operation that would run itself. The method needed to be flexible enough to use at a variety of special events. Finally, the program must actually educate and promote good heath to fulfill a key component of their Mission Statement



<P>

<STRONG>Experience:</STRONG> Health plans in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California have met these challenges by using G&K�s Educational Outreach Marketing programs for more than 8 years. A custom EP robot visits local schools presenting a scientifically validated health curriculum to area students.  In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, an advertising agency administrates the program and creates learning materials for distribution to schools and families. The custom robot mascots also make regular appearances at many public events on the client�s behalf.



<P>

<STRONG>Results:</STRONG> Robots deliver excellent, unique and memorable community visibility. Parents, principals, teachers and community leaders have expressed their thanks for these programs with thousands of letters to the sponsor.  Newspapers and television stations continue to give the clients excellent media coverage. News videos, newspaper clippings, letters and awards are available for viewing. 



<P>

The programs give the client direct contact with state, local and Federal government leaders as well as more than 357,000 families who have participated in live EOM programs.  Every teacher, child and family receives the sponsor�s printed health education materials. The best indication of this EOM�s success is that plans have expanded program use every year since its inception.

<H2>Example 3</H2>

<H3>Robo Doc - One Hospital�s Outreach Program</H3> 



<P>

<STRONG>Challenge:</STRONG> A hospital located in a rural county noted that local children were at a disturbingly high risk of tobacco, alcohol and other drug use. Area children also showed poor nutritional awareness. School budgets were limited and educational efforts were further hindered by the fact that this was a tri-racial county (black, white and American Indian). No special health programs were equally acceptable to all groups.





<P>

The hospital and its doctors wanted to promote preventive health awareness to county children and their parents. As the most successful hospital in the county, the client also wanted to improve its image of service in the neighboring rural communities.



<P>

<STRONG>Experience:</STRONG> After considering a number of options, the hospital decided to fund installation of the <A HREF="../working.htm">Million Dollar Machine</A> <!--link to MDM page--> curriculum for every elementary student in the county.  The robotic instructor generated terrific excitement in the rural area and became an instant local celebrity. Best of all, the robot teacher was equally loved by each of the three cultural groups. In addition to school programs, the hospital also had their robotic representative appear at other community functions and at the hospital itself.



<P>

<STRONG>Result:</STRONG> Television crews and reporters came from a 100 mile radius to cover the hospital�s events.  While hospitals make their money treating illness by necessity, many reporters praised this one for teaching people to avoid sickness and stay healthy.  The county Sheriff�s Department, parent�s groups and civic organizations volunteered their time to support the hospital�s effort.  Evening health education classes for parents at the hospital were well attended by parents and interested citizens.  County middle school students even petitioned the hospital to provide the program to them, a request that the hospital gladly granted.  Based on the success of the first campaign, the hospital conducted the entire county-wide program a second time four years later. 



<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In 1995, GoWell & Kent developed a special healing skills curriculum for children in health care facilities nationwide.  We invite you to visit our <A HREF="../working.htm">Super Power Tour</A> <!-- link to SPT--> page to find out more.

The Million Dollar Machine Program comes as a complete, economical, turn-key program. It includes live curriculum installation, live parent's orientation, and unlimited use of classroom lesson plans and student learning materials. Best of all, the cost is usually for less than $3 per student for a learning experience that lasts a lifetime.

<P>

<img border="0" width="22" height="20" src="../image/bullet_ani.GIF"><STRONG>Curriculum Installation</STRONG><BR>

One of our Electronic Personality robots personally visits each school, introducing teachers and students to the curriculum with a dynamic live assembly.  Up to 250 students participate in this interactive session, which lasts 35-45 minutes. Assembly content is age specific, so a maximum of 4 consecutive grade levels may attend any one session. 



<P>

<img border="0" width="22" height="20" src="../image/bullet_ani.GIF"><STRONG>Parents Orientation</STRONG><BR>

Each week of programs includes one evening session for parents and interested community members.  This special presentation gives parents a chance to meet the robot and understand the life skills lessons their children study in school.  It also familiarized parents with the student/parent worksheets included with the curriculum materials.

<A NAME="Funding"></A>

<H3>Who could help me fund MDM for my favorite school?</H3> 



<UL>

<P>

With a per student cost of only around $3, the possibilities are endless.  

<P>

In fact,  public spirited organizations, corporations and individuals fund more than 70% of all Million Dollar Machine installations.  Take a look at <A HREF="../working.htm"> client companies</A> <!--link to clients--> that have funded robotic presentations to get ideas.  Funding advice and presentation materials are available at no charge by <A HREF="../contact.htm">contacting GoWell & Kent</A>.



<P>

Groups that have funded major robotic programs include:<P>

<UL><STRONG>

	Health care providers & Plans<BR>

	Hospitals and doctors� associations<BR>

	Shopping mall merchant associations<BR>

	Science and technology museums<BR>

	Large local corporations<BR>

	Individuals, parent groups and civic organizations<BR>

</STRONG></UL>



<P>

While many corporations support public causes out of generosity when they can, there are plenty of reasons to support MDM as a sound business investment. MDM�s innovative robotic instructor gives it the high visibility needed for an excellent corporate public relations program.  Visit our <A HREF="../eom/corp.htm">Corporate Site</A>  page to understand more about how corporations benefit from sponsoring robots.

<CENTER><EM>More MDM links are available at the bottom of this page.</EM></CENTER>



<UL>



<P>

<H2>How was the MDM curriculum developed?</H2>

In 1979, Kent Davis and David GoWell invented a new type of interactive robotic character they called the <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personality.</A>  In 1980, they formed <A HREF="../gk/index.htm">GoWell & Kent, Inc.</A> <!--link to GK-1--> to explore and develop techniques to use this unique multi-media communication tool in the areas of education, marketing and entertainment.



<P>

After many informal robot trials in schools and hospitals, David and GoWell began writing the Million Dollar Machine curriculum in May 1987.  They were assisted by a distinguished group of consulting educators, psychologists and drug use prevention experts. 



<P>

The development team reviewed curricula from 19 states before developing the life skills concepts and <A HREF="learnobj.htm"></A> included in the Million Dollar Machine Program.  In the first year of development, they monitored hundreds of live robot assemblies which were then evaluated on content, student comprehension and to determine the most effective robot media teaching techniques.  The powerful, comprehensive and nationally compatible MDM curriculum is the result.



<P>

By the end of the 1989-1990 school year, more than 450,000 children in 19 states had experienced the Million Dollar Machine Program. The MDM curriculum materials and Teacher's Guides were again revised based on that field experience.  Now, more than 2,250,000 children in 42 states are benefiting from the program.  



<P>

A key factor in the program's success is the extensive knowledge that elementary school teachers contributed to refine and improve the curriculum.  Today, this process continues with pre-paid evaluations forms that are included with every Teacher�s Guide.

<P>

<H2>What are the objectives of the Million Dollar Machine Program (MDM)?</H2>

MDM is a life skills enrichment program introduced by robotic instructors called <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personalities</A> <!--link to EP-1-->.  The curriculum and its unique presentation medium was designed to give children the basic knowledge and skills they need to take control of their lives and reach their full potential.  This curriculum helps students in every area of personal and academic life by:

<UL>

	<LI>increasing self-esteem and self-responsibility.

	<LI>inspiring them to stay in school and develop a lifetime enthusiasm 

for learning.

	<LI>developing their positive social skills.

	<LI>developing their critical thinking and decision making skills.

	<LI>training them to protect themselves from drugs and other 

harmful influences.

	<LI>empowering them to take charge of themselves and our planet's future.

</UL>



<H2>MDM - Grade K-3 Learning Objectives</H2>

For Grades K-3, MDM covers 20 Learning Objectives in five sections:<BR>



<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../graphics/icn_self.gif" ALT="Self">

<H3>Self-Awareness</H3>

MDM teaches children that their bodies are irreplaceable "million dollar machines" that enable them to accomplish their dreams.  The robotic instructor delivers this message in a way no human instructor could.  The self-awareness lessons demonstrate the priceless nature of the human body, appropriate ways to deal with feelings, specific health care techniques and the ability to set and attain goals in life.<BR>

<UL>

	1.  I love myself because I'm special.<BR>

	2.  It's OK to have different feelings.<BR>

	3.  I take care of my body because it's the most valuable thing I'll ever own.<BR>

	4.  I'll grow up to be my best if I take care of my body.<BR>

</UL>



<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../graphics/icn_ips.gif" ALT="IPS">

<H3>Interpersonal Skills</H3>

Interpersonal skills activities develop your students' ability to interact and work in groups.  By examining the special qualities in others, these lessons develop empathy, courtesy, friendship, cooperation and teamwork.  The section ends by establishing the special role students have as family members.<BR>

<UL>

	5.  Everyone I meet is special.<BR>

	6.  I respect other people.<BR>

<H3>How do teachers use the MDM Teacher�s Guide?</H3>



With its robotic multi-media introduction, student retention of the MDM concepts is excellent.  The robot's dramatic delivery and the associated learning materials give teachers and parents an ongoing opportunity to stimulate excitement throughout the school year.  Each live assembly introduces 20 life skills concepts, or <A HREF="learnobj.htm">Learning Objectives</A> to students.



<P>

The MDM curriculum guide given to each teacher contains hundreds of activities that allow students to explore and fulfill each objective.  Activities are grouped in a variety of Teaching Styles to maximize each teacher�s effectiveness and student interest.  The activities were designed to integrate easily with other subjects, such as social studies, language art, science, art and music.



<H3>Is the MDM material suitable for all grade levels?</H3>

Students interpret life skills concepts at their own level of growth.  In the MDM curriculum, activities and worksheets are ungraded to allow teachers to choose the ones that best fit their students' capabilities.  In some cases, teachers assign one activity to part of the class, and a different or less demanding activity to other students.



<H3>How does the MDM program promote healthy growth in children?</H3>

Scientific research indicates that developing life skills plays a vital role in preventing childhood drug use and avoiding other dangerous behavior.  MDM�s live robotic demonstration establishes the human body as a child�s most priceless possession.  Then, MDM guides children to discover the reasons and techniques they need to decide against drug use for themselves.  Drugs become a threat to their well-being rather than an opportunity to "try a new experience" or "get away with something."



<P>

Developing self-esteem and health awareness also motivates children to protect themselves in general.  These self-protection concepts give children the desire and ability to resist many other dangers, such as stealing, risk-taking, violence or sexual misconduct.



<H3>How are learning materials organized?</H3>

Each of the 20 Learning Objectives has two pages of activities and two worksheets.<P>



<IMG SRC="../graphics/bookpic.gif" ALT="Book">



<P>

Each Learning Objective appears on the left hand page under the Section Heading.  A "Note to Teacher" gives a brief overview of the lesson.  The remainder of the first two pages contains a wide selection of activities in a variety of Teaching Styles.  This selection will help you find activities most suited to your students and curriculum requirements.  Boxes ([ ]) are provided for an easy check ([ ]) of completed exercises.



<H3>What Teaching Styles does MDM use?</H3>

MDM uses a variety of Teaching Styles to help students comprehend and retain the material.  For older children in Grades 4-6 the Teaching Styles are:<BR>



<UL>

<H3>Discuss!</H3>

This Teaching Style develops communication and interpersonal skills in the classroom.  A series of related discussion questions gives a complete introduction to each Learning Objective.  Answers are provided for fact-based questions while others allow students to explore their own feelings and opinions.  In most cases, students can deduce the answers and teach themselves and their classmates.



<H3>Investigate!</H3>

Students gather information from books, magazines, records, newspapers, reference sources and (in our next printing!) even CD-ROM libraries, databases and the Internet.  They report their findings and sources in either written or verbal form, as the teacher decides.  In addition to developing independent research, reading and computer skills, teachers find that students are more receptive to information that they locate on their own.

<H3>Create!</H3>



This style develops creative writing skills and artistic expression.  Most of these activities are presented as written assignments.  Teachers may easily adapt  many of them to be art, poetry or music projects.  Occasionally, teachers can invite students to pick their own means of expression.



<H3>Interact!</H3>

This style develops communication and interactive skills both inside and outside the classroom.  Many of these activities involve role play, games or other types of group participation.  Sometimes, a field trip is suggested. Two other types of activities in each Interact section are "Visitor" and "Interview".

<UL>

<P>

<STRONG>"Visitor"</STRONG> activities recommend special guests to invite to speak to the class.  Parents and local professional organizations are recommended sources for speakers.  Teachers explain the Learning Objective and the goal of their lesson to each visitor in advance.<BR>



<P>

<STRONG>"Interview"</STRONG> activities teach students to record and report information acquired from other people.  The subject of the interview might be a parent, guardian, relative, professional, sibling or peer.  Teachers can assign specific people or let students choose their own subjects.  Results are submitted in writing or reported to the class during moderated discussions.<BR>

</UL>



</UL>

<H3>Worksheets</H3>

Each Learning Objective has two dedicated worksheets.  The recommended procedure is for students to complete each worksheet with their parents.  The activities were specifically designed to create entertaining and educational encounters between parents and children.  Each worksheet has a Parent's Initial box to check parental participation.<BR>



<H3>Vocabulary</H3>

The Teacher�s Guide includes a list of ten vocabulary words for each Learning Objective to use in regular language arts/spelling lessons.<BR>



<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% ALIGN=center SIZE=3>



<H2>Implementing the MDM Curriculum</H2>

<H3>Why are classroom discussions so important in the MDM curriculum?</H3>

In the MDM program, student/teacher interaction is a vital component of every Learning Objective.  By covering the "Discuss!"  questions first, students gain an excellent grasp of the concepts.  This is an important preparation for completing any of the activities or worksheets.

Encouraging students to share personal experiences promotes the free exchange of information, ideas and feelings.  With teacher guidance, students suggest most of the appropriate answers themselves.  As discussion leaders, teachers act as the expert or final authority on the subject only after students have exhausted their own ideas.



<P>

Scientific research demonstrates that children have an innate knowledge of life skills.  The suggested questions draw out that knowledge.  This interrogatory style of teaching is referred to as the Socratic method.  Research and experience show that the Socratic method maximizes student comprehension and participation.  The Socratic method is particularly beneficial for students who rarely take part in classroom discussions.



<H3>What is the importance of small group activities?</H3>

The small group activities develop independence and social skills.  They also provide excellent opportunities for students to practice courtesy, sharing and cooperation.  When organizing groups, MDM recommends dividing classes in different ways to avoid always having the same students together e.g.  alphabetically, by height, by random drawing, by seating, etc.).  A responsible leader is appointed or elected to maintain order in each group.



<P>

Some small group activities may be too challenging for younger students.  In this case, alternate activities are available or the teacher can lead the activity personally.



<H3>What is the importance of role play activities in MDM?</H3>

Role playing is the most effective way to develop interactive skills.  Students must think, feel and act, responding totally to each dramatic situation.  Role play also gives students the opportunity to act out real-life situations and practice refusal skills and problem-solving techniques.



<P>

Here are a few ideas to strengthen role play activities:

<UL>

	<LI>Tell different groups of students to play the same scene.<BR>

	<LI>Repeat a role play after having students exchange roles.<BR>

	<LI>Use props and costumes to add realism or humor.<BR>

	<LI>Use sound, scenery or lighting effects to add drama.<BR>

	<LI>Ask students to perform their best skits for another class.<BR>

	<LI>Videotape sessions to play back for students and other classes.<BR>

	<LI>Ask students in the audience to write down alternative responses.<BR>

	<LI>Praise students for their performance and participation.<BR>

</UL>



<H3>How does the MDM program involve parents?</H3>

Parental involvement is essential for successful life skills development.  For that reason, this program includes a number of teaching tools that increase child/parent interaction.  MDM introduces parents to the program with a special letter they take home following the assembly.  The following two activities further develop parental interest and participation:<BR>

<P><OL>

	<LI>Teachers use the two worksheets accompanying each Learning Objective so students can practice their skills at home.  The worksheets were designed to give parents a time to share structured teaching activities with their children.  All the activities are simple and intuitive so no special training is needed.  Check boxes are provided to verify parental participation.  The worksheets also stimulate family interest and discussions on important topics.<BR>



	<P><LI>MDM encourages inviting parents to be "Visitors" whenever possible.  Student parents are a terrific resource with a variety of diverse careers, skills, talents, hobbies, travel experiences and cultural backgrounds.  Once a few parents participate, others will want to contribute as well.<BR>

</OL>



<H3>How do teachers maintain MDM�s excitement throughout the year?</H3>

The MDM development team came up with a few ideas to help:

<UL>

<STRONG>Be regular!</STRONG> Schedule a daily or weekly "Million Dollar Machine Time" to use these lessons.  Scientific evidence demonstrates that life skills curricula are more effective when presented over an extended period.

<P>

<STRONG>Be flexible!</STRONG>  Explore some of the Learning Objectives on a purely verbal level.  Just a few minutes of discussion or role play will accomplish a great deal.  Teachers can also use the ready made worksheets to save time on written assignments.

<P>

<STRONG>Share!</STRONG>  Get together with other teachers to exchange ideas on activities that were particularly effective.  Teachers can also share suggestions with the MDM development team by filling out a postpaid evaluation form in the back of every Teacher�s Guide.

<P>

<STRONG>Take it easy!</STRONG>  Having students teach each other makes these lessons most effective.  Children are often more likely to adopt positive attitudes and good morals from their peers than they are from teachers and parents.

<P><STRONG>Integrate!</STRONG>  This program benefit students in every area of their lives.  Teachers can easily combine the activities with regular social studies, language arts, science, art and music lessons.

<P><STRONG>Have fun!</STRONG>  Everyone who experiences the Million Dollar Machine introduction remembers the enthusiastic response to the robot's assembly.  The activities and worksheets in the MDM guide recreate that excitement.  Thousands of educators across the country already know that the MDM curriculum is fun and easy to teach.  And that it works.
