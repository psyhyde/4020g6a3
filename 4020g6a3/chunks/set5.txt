<H1>British Gas Research and Technology Division - Design of an intelligent test rig for pre-paid gas metering schemes</H1> 


<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>
<P>British Gas are the UK's primary commercial and domestic gas supplier. For many years they have installed coin-operated gas meters to meet the needs of certain customers. Because these meters hold coins, they have proved to be targets for vandalism and theft. British Gas Research and technology division have therefore developed several schemes for meters which use plastic keys, magnetic strip cards and smart cards as a credit medium.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>
<P>A test rig had to be implemented to assess the reliability of the payment schemes outlined above before embarking on a nation-wide installation programme.</P>

<P>The test rig had to pick up the keys or cards from feeds, then insert and remove them from the meters. In the case of the cards, it was necessary to place each one into a card programming device first. All results were to be logged automatically on a PC.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>

<P>The first step in the design of the test rig was to use Workspace to try out various layout ideas and compare the performance of different robots for the application.</P>

<P>The robot, gas meter, card programmer, feeding mechanism and other components were all modelled using the simulation's integrated CAD system. then, several different industrial robots were placed in the Workspace computer model and tested. The most appropriate layout was quickly found by comparing the times for one complete test cycle.</P>

<P>After evaluation on the simulator, an Alpha2 robot was chosen as the ideal robot. The robot was subsequently purchased and the test rig was built.</P>

<H2>British Gas' financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>Simulation using Workspace enabled different robots to be evaluated for the task before purchase.</P>

<P>The test rig was built on a "right first time" basis.</P>

<P>Workspace prevented costly mistakes during the development of the project.</P>

<H1>Glaxo Group Research Ltd - Robot Motion Simulation In Support Of System Design, Application Development, Management Decision Making And User Training</H1> 

<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>

<P>Glaxo Group Research Ltd are part of the pharmaceutical giant Glaxo. They are based in Hertfordshire, England and have large research laboratories there. Their BioEngineering unit is engaged in research to develop automated systems in support of innovative laboratory procedures to improve effectiveness, quality, safety and productivity in development of ethical pharmaceuticals.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>
<P>Skilled laboratory staff currently spend 25% of their time performing the tedious and repetitive job of accessing the company's large reference collection of pharmaceutical compounds. Installing an automated storage and retrieval system would free those laboratory staff to concentrate on other work.</P>

<P>Before an installation can take place, the design under consideration must be "proven" to work. The conventional approach for Glaxo is to take drawings of the design and use them to build "non-functional" models whose sole purpose is to illustrate the design concept. The next stage is to build a moving "proof of principle" model with which to investigate the functional capability of the system.</P>

<P>Speed of development is a key issue, and Glaxo purchased Workspace to provide additional capability to their design department.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>
<P>Glaxo's proposed solution is to install a completely new design of robotic storage and retrieval system.</P>

<P>The arrangement was modelled on Workspace and moving devices simulated. Workspace enabled the BioEngineering department to check that the design achieved its specification. In addition, estimates of retrieval times were automatically calculated to judge the efficiency of the system. Using Workspace, the model can be changed effortlessly to experiment with alternative layouts.</P>

<P>A moving animation of the design clearly communicated the concept to management and end users, promoting informed discussion and leading to the system's optimisation, acceptance and approval.</P>

<H2>The future</H2>

<P>Mike Duncan of Glaxo Group Research stated that, in future Workspace will be used as follows:-</P>
<P>"Illustrate the proposed arrangements of automated systems; it will offer, in addition, the opportunity to experiment quickly and cheaply with alternative layouts."<P>

<P>"Ensure that the physical layout of the system does not clash with the surrounding environment and related equipment either at rest or at any point in its operational cycle."</P>

<P>"Optimise the functional design and operational procedure of the system during development to ensure that the first-off, which may be the only example, requires little or no  modification to achieve the standard of structural integrity and behavioural refinement required for performance critical applications in a sophisticated science-oriented environment."</P>

<P>"Workspace will reduce the need to build models and will provide a basis for 'right-first-time' development of special purpose laboratory automation."</P>

<H2>Glaxo's financial justification for Workspace</H2>
<P>Faster accomplishment of automation projects.</P>
<P>Reduced requirement for rectification during system development prior to commissioning.</P>
<P>Reduced requirement for physical models during the planning, design and development programme.</P>

<H1>Cimtas AS - Optimising reach and off-line programming in an arc welding workcell</H1> 

<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>

<P>Cimtas are a Turkish company involved in the construction industry. They specialise in the fabrication and installation of heavy steel structures, cranes and pressure vessels. They manufacture in the region of 24,000 tonnes of steel structures per year and have over 1800 employees.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>

<P>Cimtas arc weld large I-beams on their production line and have recently purchased both Fanuc Arcmate and REIS SRV12L robots to form part of their manufacturing system.</P>

fig.1

fig.2

<P>The I-beams are placed on a rotating table mechanism (D) which may be positioned manually along a linear track (C). by an operator (See fig.1). Once the beam is in place, the rotating overhead mechanism (A) swings the robot across into the appropriate position to start welding. Height of the robot above the floor may be adjusted manually at B.</P>

<P>Before using Workspace, the robot program was generated entirely by using the teach pendant on the shop floor. Since 9 axes are used, it can be difficult for the operator to visualise all possible configurations. Due to the size of the I-beams, Cimtas have encountered many problems in getting the robots to achieve satisfactory welds without exceeding a robot joint limit or having the welding tool collide with the workpiece. It is possible to move the robot up and down along the vertical track B, but only by unbolting it and winching it into position. This makes it difficult to experiment with different heights above the floor.</P>

<H2>Project aims</H2>
<P>To experiment with different robot and table configurations to maximise the work envelope.</P>

<P>To minimise the possibility of a collision when the robot re-orients itself during its task.</P>

<P>To improve safety for the human operator.</P>

<P>To reduce the need for teach pendant programming.</P>

<P>To optimise the robot program and reduce cycle time.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>
<P>A model of the workcell was created with Workspace and the SRV12L and Arcmate were compared for reachability. The Workspace facility to plot the working envelope was used to position the work piece optimally. It was immediately found that in this application, the Reis SRV12L robot allowed a greater working envelope, so this robot was chosen in place of the Arcmate for the workcell.</P>

<P>By using Workspace it was possible to make the vertical track B a translational joint on the rotating column A. This allowed the height of the robot to be optimised by simply changing a variable in the simulation. Work then began on developing a set of teach points which the robot could follow without hitting a joint limit or colliding with the workpiece.</P>

<P>It was found that repositioning the column A between welds enabled several particularly difficult moves to be achieved. Previously, Cimtas had simply placed the mechanism so that it was at right angles to the linear track C for the duration of the cycle.</P>

<P>Collisions tended to arise if the robot was forced to reorient the wrist during a linear move along a welding seam. The simulation highlights any collisions and allows the user to abandon a move and immediately try another approach.</P>

<H2>Cimtas' financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>A complete set of teach points to perform the task was generated. These teach points were later used directly in a new program generated on Cimtas' text-based off line programming system.</P>

<P>Time to develop the new program was reduced by over 40%.</P>

<P>Development of the new program was achieved off-line while the robot was operating.</P>

<P>A technical decision was made to use only Reis robots for the larger workpieces in Cimtas's manufacturing workcell.</P>

<P>The risk of damage to personnel and equipment was eliminated.</P>

<H1>University of Plymouth: The Foundation Of a New Course - BSc Robotics & Automation Systems</H1> 
</HEAD>

<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>
<P>The University of Plymouth is the first UK university to offer a course in Robotics & Automation Systems. The course has been developed to address the need for graduate engineers with a good knowledge of automated manufacturing systems.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>
<P>An essential theme in the course is that of practical "hands-on" experience of robots. The University currently has eleven small educational robots and an industrial ABB IRB1000.</P>

<p>To date, students have had to work in teams, having access to the robots only during laboratory sessions. Clearly more industrial robots had to be made available to provide students with the necessary access to modern robotic hardware. An ideal solution would be to provide each student with their own robot, which they could use at any time in complete safety.</P>

<P>The prohibitive cost of industrial robots is only the first barrier to the undertaking of such a course. Student safety is also a prime consideration. Additional staff would be needed to supervise laboratory sessions and access at other times would be impossible.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>
<P>Combining practical laboratory sessions with Workspace provided the answer. The simulation system is now used as the foundations for all robotic modules on the course. Students may use Workspace to load a model of an industrial robot, create a workcell using the integrated CAD system and write robot programs. This can be done at any time of the day using one of the University's PCs.</P>

<P>Students may even construct their own mechanisms in Workspace and experiment with different controller parameters, plotting graphs to show the effect on robot dynamics.</P>

<P>Simulated robotic projects can be developed in complete safety. In addition, the newly introduced Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) features in Workspace have enabled the creation of interactive training exercises by course tutors.</P>

<P>The University now intends to start an active Workspace users group which will pool CAL material world-wide from a wide range of institutions.</P>

<H2>Benefits</H2>
<P>Savings on robotic hardware allowed more students to enrol</P>
<P>Use of simulation software made the course more attractive to prospective students</P>
<P>Safety problems were overcome</P>
<P>Students could apply newly learnt principles outside of laboratory sessions</P>

<H2>The University's financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>Establishment of the course would not have been possible without a simulation system</P>

<P>Workspace provides the best possible price/performance ratio</P>

<P>Academic staff were free to concentrate on teaching rather than safety supervision</P>

<TITLE>Komatsu UK - Design of a new arc welding workcell</TITLE>

<body background="paper3.gif">
<H1>Komatsu UK - Design of a new arc welding workcell</H1> 

<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>

<P>Komatsu UK manufacture and export a range of excavators worldwide. Their production line is highly automated, using robots to improve quality in the construction of large, steel components.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>

<P>Komatsu needed to build a new workcell for a component that previously had to be welded by hand. The component has a number of difficult seams to weld, requiring the welding torch to fit into a confined space.</P>

<P>The component is approximately 2m long and is constructed using steel plate. The welding seams must lie horizontally with the welding torch making an angle of 45 degrees between adjacent faces.</P>

<P>The torch moves at about 15cm per minute, so the part must be positioned carefully for a good weld.</P>

<P>The weld illustrated as A-B in the diagram opposite is a particularly difficult one since the welding torch must fit between two plates to get to the seam.</P>

<H2>Project Aims</H2>
<P>Weld at least 80% of the seams by robot</P>

<P>Design and evaluate an appropriate positioning device</P>

<P>Evaluate the robot's welding torch design</P>

<P>Test for collisions</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>
<P>The Komatsu robot (KHY660) was modelled on Workspace and the component was imported in the form of a DXF file. Once this was done a model of a positioner was created.</P>

<P>Originally, a positioner with 3 axes was to be built especially for this task. However, since this was expensive, Komatsu wished to evaluate a spare positioner they had at the plant. This NEI Thompson 2-axis positioner was left over from a previous job but did not appear to offer the same flexibility as the original positioner design.</P>

<P>Workspace was used to test whether this positioner could place the component correctly for all welding seams.</P>

<P>Here is a diagram of the final proposed workcell:-</P>
 
<P>(Note that the clamps used to secure the part to the positioner are not shown.)</P>

<P>The robot work envelope is shown hatched in the diagram to the right and the torch is shown on the weld A-B.</P>

<P>On attempting to "weld" the part, Workspace demonstrated that part of the robot tool would collide with the component in the proposed layout. By interactively changing the positioner joint angles it was discovered that there was one position where the tool could perform the weld without collisions.</P>

<P>The new design (using the 2-axis positioner) was proved to be more effective than the original proposal.</P>

<P>All welds were found to be within reach, although the welding torch length was to be reduced to provide adequate clearance along seam A-B.</P>

<P>The 2-axis positioner exceeded expectations, since it was also capable of carrying a different component for another task within the same workcell setup.</P>

<H2>Komatsu's financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>By recycling an unused positioner, cost savings in excess of �60,000 were made.</P>

<P>Time to develop the system was significantly reduced.</P>

<P>Komatsu kept full control over the design process.</P>

<p><font size=5><em><b>What is Workspace&#174;?</b></em></font><font size=4><em> </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><b>Workspace is a sophisticated 3D graphical simulation software system for robotics and 
mechanisms. Running on a PC, Workspace offers features previously found only on high 
specification graphics workstations. It is a productivity tool designed to make the 
implementation of advanced manufacturing systems as simple and economical as possible.<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=5><em><b>Why Simulation?</b></em></font><font size=4><em> </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><b>Automation system are increasing in complexity to a level where industry requires 
sophisticated tools to assist in the design and implementation of the manufacturing process. <img src="gif/buffers2.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 width=300 height=210></b></font> 
<font size=4><b>Visualising how a multiple-axis device will move in 3D 
space is a difficult task, especially when such factors 
such as reachability, collision detection and 
avoidance, cycle times and production levels have to 
be taken into consideration.<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=4><b>Workspace can increase your productivity and 
reduce system down-time. System programming, 
before robot installation can take place or while an 
existing workcell is in operation. Complex layouts can 
be tested in complete safety either in an office environment or on the shop floor. Simulation 
highlights potential problems before they happen, allowing quick and easy modifications.<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em><b>The New Design concept</b></em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><b>3D Simulation has revolutionised the ways that engineers can work. Workspace lets you add 
equipment to a workcell, delete or move objects for the most complex of robotics 
applications, reducing development time and ensuring a complete solution.<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em><b>Is Workspace easy to learn?</b></em></font><em> </em></p>
<p><font size=4><b>The user interface has been designed with clarity, simplicity and ease of use in mind. The 
system uses menus and windows driven by either keyboard or mouse. Related commands are 
grouped together to make them easy to find. Context sensitive help minimises the need to 
refer continuously to the manuals. However: a large format manual in the form of a reference 
manual, user guide and guided tour is supplied. The friendly nature of the Workspace's 
operation is reflected in the number of Educational and Training establishment around the 
world who are already using the system.<br>

<TITLE>The Telemanipulation  option for Workspace</TITLE> 
</HEAD>
<BODY background="paper3.gif">
<H1 align=center>The Telemanipulation  option for Workspace</H1>

<P>The Workspace telemanipulation option allows a user to monitor the status of  a real work-cell graphically. This feature allows robots to be operated remotely, with the operator using Workspace to view the current robot status.</P>

<P>The user first creates a model of the real work-cell using the Workspace CAD system (IGES/DXF data can be imported if so desired). The robot models they require to build this virtual world can be selected from a library of over 140 robots (they can alternatively create their own robots).</P>

<P>Data from the real world is accessed via a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL). The user has access to the source code which creates the DLL and they insert their own software modules into the DLL to bring external data into the PC. This external data could for example, be joint encoder data from a real robot describing the positions of robot joints or robot auxiliary axes within the real work-cell.</P>

<P>The code interface to the DLL from Workspace allows up to 9 robot models or mechanisms to be controlled by external data. When the telelmanipulation option is set in motion Workspace passes into the DLL either a robot's current position, a robot's current joint angles or a robot's current gripper status. This data is combined with the external data in a user definable way to provide a set of demanded positions (or joint angles) which are then passed back into Workspace for the robot models to achieve.</P>

<P>The viewing mode can be either wire-frame, hidden-line or solid-shade. With more complex viewing modes like solid-shade the refresh speed for the graphical display decreases. Wire-frame has the quickest refresh rate.</P>

<P>To modify the DLL the user needs a software compiler capable of creating Workspace compatible DLLs. The code we supply to create the telemanipulation DLL is designed for use with Borland Pascal v7.0. </P>
<P>DLLs can also be generated using C and we can supply C code for Borland C v4.0  to create compatible DLLs.</P>

<TITLE>WORKSPACE changes from 3.4 to 3.5</TITLE> 
<H1>WORKSPACE changes from 3.4 to 3.5</H1> 

<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>The most important new feature in 3.5 is the ability to easily offline program applications using Workspace geometry point paths. The applications include spot welding, arc welding, paint spraying, material handling, sealant, laser cutting, water jet and deburring. Once the geometry path has been created and saved with the model the user can issue a Follow GP path command to automatically create and simulate the robot programme in whatever robot language is currently selected. Tool graphics have been designed to simulate each tool action.</P>

<P>Many new <A HREF="language.htm">robot languages</A> are now available as options for Workspace including:</P>
<P>ABB Rapid, Yaskawa/Motoman Inform1 and Inform2, Sankyo and IBM AML2, PSI.</P>

<P>The commands for editing GP paths have been improved, as have the commands for editing geometry points, editing several geometry points at once (multiple GPs), and editing teachpoints. The commands for editing several geometry points should save the user some time over the old GP edit methods. Many of the new commands for editing teachpoints are useful in reverse engineering and re-engineering workcells, and for last minute touch-ups of robot programs during offline programming.</P>

<P>The user-interface and the efficiency of the <A HREF="rtrkspec.htm">robot and tool calibration</a> have been improved, while the Robotrak setup procedures have been altered to increase their reliability even when used by inexperienced users.</P>

<P>In general, the changes in 3.5 reflect the past few years' accumulated experience from both within RSL and close contact with industrial customers of simulating and offline programming complex workcells using <b>Workspace</b> and <b>Robotrak</b></P>

<P>These features now give the customer an affordable, user friendly tool to carry out the most complex of tasks at shop floor level with confidence.</P>

<H2>New and changed commands</H2>

<H3>MODEL MENU</H3>

<P>1. Load object into model: when a model has been selected the objects displayed will be only those with no parents.</P>
<P>2. Set project directory : now sets the Ready for robot directory to projectdir/ROBOT.</P>
<P>3. Make directory : copies a file to a path (which is relative to the WS3 directory).</P>

<H3>CREATE MENU</H3>

<H4>Create GPs submenu</H4>

<P>1. The Create Gps on polyline submenu now has the additional command Between two polylines which creates GPs along the current polyline in the direction of the nearest point on the other polyline. This is useful if the GPs are being defined on part whose geometry is represented by two parallel polylines.</P>
<P>2. Create Gps over entire polyline and Create Gps over entire surface boundary: the commands on these menus work in a similar way to the Create GPs on polyline and the Create Gps over surface boundary except that by default the first GP is at the beginnings of the polyline and the second GP is at the end of the polyline.</P>
<P>3. Align axes with tangent: when this flag is on then when GPs are created along a polyline or a surface boundary their default position has the normal vector normal to the tangent (as was the case in Workspace 3.4), whereas when the flag is off the normal vector of the GPs is not normal to the tangent.</P>
<P>4.Create exact GP  path on polyline: this is the Exact GP path command renamed.</P>

<H3>LAYOUT MENU</H3>

<H4>Edit object submenu</H4>

<P>1. Information: colour, view, and non-joint axes added.</P>

<H4>Edit robot submenu</H4>

<P>1. Approach vector: moved from Options menu - now saved with the robot model. Used to decide orientation when creating GPs relative to an object feature.</P>

<H4>Edit tools submenu</H4>

<P>1. Attach tool: moves the current object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command.</P>
<P>2. Load and attach tool: same as attach tool except that it also loads the tool object from a model file. Loads an object and then positions the object so that its base frame coincides with the coordinate frame of the end link of the robot. A base frame may be defined for an object using the Add tool base frame command.</P>
<P>The user can create models containing tools as a library for this command. To create a library of tools simply create a model containing all the tools and then save the model.</P>
<P>3. Dispose of tool: allows the user to select and delete one of the objects (and its descendants) attached to the end link of the robot.</P>
<P>4. Add tool base frame: adds a coordinate frame to the current object. This may be edited using the Move axes and Turn axes commands (on the Edit joint menu). The frame is used when automatically positioning a tool on the end of the robot (see Attach tool).</P>
<P>5. Gripper of interest: specify which of several grippers on a robot is being referred to. when setting gripper parameters on this menu.</P>
<P>6. Time to open gripper: sets the time taken to open or close the gripper of interest during a simulation.</P>
<P>6. Spot weld gun of interest: specify which of several spot weld guns on a robot is being referred to when setting gun parameters on this menu.</P>
<P>7. Spot weld duration: set the duration of a spot weld (when the gun is closed) by the gun of interest during a simulation.</P>
<P>8. Gun closed to semi-open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from closed to semi-open during a simulation.</P>
<P>9. Gun semi-open to open time: set the time taken for the spot weld gun of interest to go from semi-open to full open during a simulation.</P>

<H4>Edit current pointer/Edit geometry point/Edit teachpoint submenus</H4>

<P>1. Move/Turn CP/TP/GP: Several commands have been renamed so that phrase approach vector is used instead of z-axis:- Move along approach vector, Approach vector up, Approach vector down, Reverse approach vector, Approach vector away from base, Drag approach vector.</P>

<H4>Edit geometry point submenu</H4>

<P>Some options have been moved onto the Edit multiple GP submenu.</P>

<H4>Edit multiple geometry points submenu</H4>

<P>Almost all the commands on this menu operate on a group of GPs selected using the multiple object selection side bar.</P>
<P>1. Create Tps from Gps submenu (contains Create TPs from multiple GPs, Create Tps from all GPs).</P>
<P>2. Change Gps approach vector: changes the approach vector for the selected GPs. Options are Arla to TP (converts GPs created in the ARLA language assuming an x-axis approach vector into GPs suitable for use in the TP language where a z-axis approach vector is assumed) and TP to Arla These options may be used with other languages which have similar approach vectors to TP and Arla.</P>
<P>3. Remove tool from GPs: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using an active tool frame but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the faceplate of the robot at each teachpoint. (see also Add tool to GPs).</P>
<P>4. Add tool to Gps: removes the current tool frame from the GPs. This is useful if the GPs were created from teachpoints using a nil tool frame so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot, but the user wishes to view the GPs as though they were representing the position of the end of the robot tool at each teachpoint. (see also Remove tool from GPs).</P>
<P>5. Turn GPs about own x-axis: turn all the GPs about their own x-axis.</P>
<P>6. Turn GPs about own y-axis: turn all the GPs about their own y-axis.</P>
<P>7. Turn GPs about own z-axis: turn all the GPs about their own z-axis.</P>
<P>8. Autoturn GPs about approach vector:attempts to find a suitable angle to turn all the GPs about their approach vector such that all the GPs become achievable by the current robot, then performs the turn.</P>

<H4>Edit teachpoint submenu</H4>

<P>Some options have been moved onto the Edit all teachpoints submenu.</P>
<P>1. Autoturn TP about approach vector: allows the user to interactively turn the teachpoint about its approach vector, showing as it is turned the position of the robot with its tool moved to the teachpoint.</P>

<H4>Edit all teachpoints submenu</H4>
<P>1. Create Gps from all TPs: creates a geometry point for each teachpoint. If the user wishes then the GPs may also store the teachpoint configuration, or if auxiliary axes are present the GPs may store the auxiliary axes positions.</P>
<P>2. Reflect all TPs using joints: reflects all the teachpoints by adjusting the joint angles. Joint angles 1, 4, and 6 are reversed for each teachpoint. The effect of this on most revolute robots is to reflect the coordinate frames of each teachpoint through a plane passing through joint 1 and its zero position. By reflecting in this way instead of reflecting the coordinate frames of the teachpoints the user ensures that the reflected teachpoints also reflect the robot configurations of the original points.</P>
<P>The user is prompted for the name of the robot onto which the new teachpoint file is to be reflected.</P>
<P>3. Adjust all TPs for different TCP: removes the current tool frame from the teachpoints (so that they represent the position of the faceplate of the robot) and adds in a tool frame selected by the user (so that the teachpoints now represent the position of the end of the new robot tool).</P>
<P>4. Turn all TPs about approach vector: turns all the teachpoints about their approach vectors.</P>
<P>5. Move all TPs: moves all the teachpoints through an x,y,z offset relative to the base frame of the robot.</P>
<P>6. Move all TPs using 1 point shift: moves all the teachpoints through a transform defined by the desired position and the old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint.</P>
<P>7. Adjust all TPs for bent tool: changes the tcp value (while adjusting the teachpoints so that the position of the faceplate of the robot at each point does not change) using a transform defined by the desired position and old position of a teachpoint. The user first teaches a teachpoint on the robot to represent the desired position of a teachpoint with the bent or changed tool, saves this in the same file as the old teachpoints, brings the file to Workspace, then issues the command and selects the new teachpoint and the old teachpoint.</P>

<H4>Edit GP path submenu</H4>

<P>1.GP path application: sets the application for which the user is using the GP path. The Edit GP path as menu will only allow the user to select Tool actions which are appropriate for the application. Possible applications are waterjet, spot welding, arc welding,  paint spraying, material handling, sealant, laser cutting, and deburring. The user may change the application at any time and then start selecting tool states for the new application.</P>
<P>2. Edit current GP as menu: allows the user to change the properties of a particular node on a GP path, the node being the one containing the current GP object. Each node contains a GP object, various motion properties used to approach that GP from the previous GP node, various actions (including tool actions) which are to be implemented once the robot reaches the GP. The properties of a GP node are described in more detail below:</P>
<P>GP object name - name of a geometry point object;</P>
<P>Motion type - the type of motion (joint, circular, or linear);</P>
<P>Termination type - the type of termination at the point expressed as a percentage (0 indicates stop at the point, 100 indicates move through or near the point without stopping);</P>
<P>Velocity - percentage of the maximum velocity to use when moving towards the GP;</P>
<P>Acceleration - percentage of the maximum acceleration to use when moving towards the GP;</P>
P>Wait time - time for the robot to wait (be stationary) after reaching the GP;</P>
<P>Routine to call - the name of a routine which is to be called once the GP is reached;</P>
<P>Signal - the type of signal ling to do once the GP is reached - options are No signal, EnterInterferenceZone (wait for a signal from another robot saying that the other robot has left a zone of interference, then once it is received send a signal to the other robot saying that it has entered the zone of intereference), LeaveInterferenceZone (send a signal to another robot saying that it has left a zone of interference). Note that interference zones in this context do not need to have their physical bounds described but are defined by when on the GP path the signals are sent;</P>
<P>Tool action - the tool action to be performed after the robot reaches the GP. Possible values are defined by the application (see GP path application) but examples are ArcOn and ArcOff (for arc welding) and PaintSprayOn and PaintSprayOff (for paint spraying). Different tool graphics are displayed during a simulation of the robot following the GP path as each action is executed.</P>
<P>3. Edit current GP path as menu: performs the same task as Edit current GP as menu except that it brings up all the GPs on the path at once.</P>
<P>4. Edit GP path as text: Allows the user to edit a GP path as though it were a text file. Note that the GP path is really an object which is saved with the model in the model file. When the user uses the Edit GP path as text command Workspace converts the path into a text file temporarily, then converts it back from a text file to a GP object when the user exits from the edit. Parts of GP paths may be easily cut and pasted between different GP paths using the text edit commands (control-k b to mark the beginning of a block, control-k k to mark the end of a block, control-k w to write a block to a file, control-k r to read a block from a file).</P>
<P>5. Append GP path: appends a GP path to the current GP path.</P>
<P>6. Break GP path before GP: Breaks a GP path just before the current GP.</P>
<P>7. Reverse GP path: reverses the current GP path.</P>
<P>8. Insert GP at start: inserts a GP at the start of the current GP path.</P>
<P>9. Insert GP after current GP: inserts a GP into a GP path just after the current GP.</P>
<P>10. Delete GP: Deletes a GP node from the current GP path (note that the GP is only deleted from the GP path - the GP object itself is not deleted).</P>
<P>11. Move GP to start of path: moves a GP node to the beginnings of the current GP path.</P>
<P>12. Move GP to after current GP: moves a GP to after the current GP in the GP path.</P>
<P>13. Scale all speeds: scales the speeds of all the GP nodes in the current path using a scaling factor. A scaling factor of 1 indicates no change.</P>
<P>14. Change all termination types: sets the termination types for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a value entered by the user. A termination type of 0 indicates that the robot is to stop at all the points, while a termination type of 100 indicates that the robot is to move through or near all the points without stopping.</P>
<P>15. Change all motion types: changes the motion type (joint, linear or circular) for all the GP nodes on the current GP path to a new setting.</P>
<P>16. Remove all tool action: removes all the tool actions from a GP path (e.g. ArcOn, ArcOff).</P>

<H3>Simulate menu</H3>

<P>1. Replay  track and create geometry path: replays a track while creating a geometry path which represents the movement of the robot during the track and any tool actions during the track. This command may be used to create geometry paths from a robot program written in one robot language which is then converted using the Follow GP path  command into a robot program written in another robot language.</P>
<P>2. Replay track and record sweep: replays a track while creating lines to represent the sweep of the tool attached to the end of the robot as the robot moves. Enables the user to quickly see if the tool interferes with any fixtures.</P>
<P>3. Send to robot and receive from robot have been implemented for a wider range of robots. Note that the Calibration filter is used only when converting between GPs and TPs (e.g. when GPs are converted to TPs during a Send to robot), or when using the Recalibrate tool or Calibrate model submenu commands. The calibration filter is not used on teachpoints which are Sent to robot or Received from robot under any other circumstances.</P>
<P>4. Edit any file: allows the user to edit any text file.</P>

<H3>Options menu</H3>

<P>1. The Paintshade option has been removed. Shade should be used instead.</P>

<H4>Picture submenu</H4>

<P>1. Hiddenline mode: Full indicates that the hiddenline removal will still be rigorous even when the user zooms in or out on a workcell, whereas Clipped means that hiddenline removal is not performed for objects which are completely off the screen. Clipped may be slightly faster than Full for large and complex workcells but if Clipped is on and the user zooms out then the picture of the workcell may no longer have the outer hidden lines removed correctly.</P>

<H4>Robot options submenu</H4>

<P>1. Autoplace robot using TPs: attempts to find a suitable position to place the robot that will allow all the teachpoints to be achievable. The search is conducted in the plane parallel to the screen which passes through the current pointer. During the search a cross is drawn at each position which would be suitable for placing the robot, and at the end of the search the user has the option of placing the robot at a suitable position.</P>
<P>2. Autoplace robot using multiple GPs: works in a similar way to the Autoplace robot using TPs command except that the search is for a position for placing the robot that will make the selected geometry points achievable.</P>
<P>3. Label current robot: when this flag is on then the current robot will be labelled on the screen with its name. This is useful when working with several robots in one workcell.</P>
<P>4. Robot tool path: when this flag is on then the path taken during an arc-weld or a laser cut or a water jet cut will be displayed as a series of lines.</P>

<H4>TP and GP option submenu</H4>

<P>1. Geometry path display: when this flag is on then geometry paths will be displayed as a dotted line between geometry points with arrows indicating the direction of movement along the geometry path.</P>

<H4>Calibrate robot submenu</H4>

<P>The Calibrate robot submenus have been reorganised so that the user can follow step by step what to do next during a calibration.<P>
<P>After each step in the setup Workspace checks that the encoder units have returned to zero and that the repeatability has not degraded.</P>
<P>1. The Robotrak setup menu has been reorganised as follows (note that some commands have been moved to the Robotrak special options submenu):</P>
<P>Exact length of bar:</P>
<P>Set all zero positions:</P>
<P>Check repeatabilities: it is important to check that when the cords are pulled away from the Robotrak units then returned to their zero position that the repeatability of the zero reading is good. This command displays the readings for all three encoders on the screen so that the user can pull each cord out (at least 2m) then return the cord to its zero (for at least 0.5 of a second) until the colour of the reading changes from red to black and a beep is heard (indicating that three successive zero readings were within three encoder counts of each other). If there are three people available to do the set up then all three cords can be checked for repeatability at once.</P>
<P>Set encoder bar length (timed): This sets the encoder bar length for each bar in turn. The user has 15 seconds from the issue of this command to place the bar on encoder unit 1. After 15 seconds a reading is taken. The user then has 15 seconds to prepare for a reading from encoder unit 2, and a further 15 seconds to prepare for the reading from encoder unit 3. The command is structured this way so that one person can set up Robotrak without assistance.</P>
<P>Set distance between bases:  The user can either set the distance between the bases one at a time as in Workspace 3.4, or set the distances between all three bases all at once (not recommended for accurate work because the sharp angles of the cords can degrade the repeatability of the measurements and setting all distances at once forces the user to pull the cord over sharp angles).</P>
<P>Length of top part of cord 1:</P>
<P>Length of top part of cord 2:</P>
<P>Length of top part of cord 3:</P>
<P>Continuous cord reading:</P>
<P>Continuous measurement reading:</P>
<P>Auto-setup: auto-setup runs through all the above commands one at a time in succession without the user having to select the command.</P>
<P>2.  Check teachpoints suitable: checks that the current teachpoint file contains teachpoints which provide an adequate range of joint values for each joint to ensure a good calibration (the joint 4 wrist must be flipped for a good calibration), and that the teachpoints are not too close to the plane of Robotrak since that would degrade the accuracy of the measurements.</P>
<P>3. Auto-record Robotrak measurements:</P>
<P>4. Extract errors from measurements:</P>
<P>5. The new Robotrak special options submenu is organised as follows:</P>
<P>Card base address:</P>
<P>Card version:</P>
<P>Record Robotrak measurements:</P>
<P>Test calibrated robot:</P>
<P>Test using box:</P>
<P>Calibrate tool z-axis:</P>
<P>Calibrate tool x-axis:</P>
<P>Record trajectory:</P>
<P>Turn Robotrak display off:</P>
<P>Calibrated robot:</P>
<P>XYZ teachpoint filter:</P>
<P>Parameters to calibrate:</P>

<P>1. At least four teachpoints are now recommended when recalibrating a tool (instead of 3 which were recommended in 3.4).</P>

<H3>Pendant menu</H3>

<P>Joint zero: sets all the joints of the current robot or mechanism to their zero position.</P>

<H2>Other Changes</H2>

<P>1. The cycles times obtained with Fanuc robots are now more accurate than before since they use the same trajectory generation algorithms that are used on Fanuc controllers. The accuracy of the cycle times for other robot languages should also be improved.</P>
<P>2. The tool actions described under Geometry Paths are also available from the action menu.</P>
<P>3. The Workspace signaldef input directive can now take just a robotname as a parameter (though the old signaldef command which took the parameters trackname and external track signal number is still valid). The Workspace signaldef output directive is no longer required, but would still be valid is used.</P>
<P>4. The multiple object selection sidebar which is used with many commands contains a new option: Path. When this is selected then the user chooses a name of a geometry point path and all the geometry points on that path are selected.</P>
<P>5. The Weldpos and Deburrpos functions are now available for use in a Joint expression. They work in a similar way to the Grippos function. The Weldpos varies from 0 to 100 as a spot weld gun goes from full-open to closed, while the deburr function varies 0 to 360 and then returns to zero and repeats all the time that deburring is on.</P>
<P>6. Macros may now be created using the programme structure and variables of the Karel2 language. Create a macro by starting a track and then issuing commands from several other menus. As each command is issued it is stored in the track, and if the track is replayed then the commands are executed from the track. Not all the commands on the menus are available for use in Macros at present.</P>

<h2>Robot accuracy for off-line programming</h2>

<p>The repeatability of most industrial robots (the ability to return repeatedly to a given 
position) is usually much better than the world accuracy (the ability to move to a specified 
xyz value in space). A typical repeatability is about 0.1mm while a typical world accuracy is of 
the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot on-line using a 
hand-held teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. 
However, when programming a robot using some off-line system to generate the robot locations 
numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important.</p>
<P>In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability.
 The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances 
involved in the production of each robot that are not taken into account within the robot 
controller. Each robot therefore has its own individual 'signature'. The most significant sources 
of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths, in the zero position of each joint, in the 
alignment of joint axes, and in the joint compliance (a torsional spring effect dur to the effect 
of the weight of the payload on the gear transmission). These errors together can account for more 
than 95% of the overall positional error.</P>
<P>What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the robot's 
end effector, compare this with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find 
estimates for these errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy obtained when off-line 
programming the robot.</P>

<h2>An overview of Robotrak</h2>

<P>Robotrak is an optional measuring system for Workspace that is used to calibrate the robot. 
It is capable of measuring static positions or motion paths to an accuracy greater than 0.2mm in 
three dimensions.</P>

<center><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="calib1.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]"></IMG></center>
<center>The Robotrak 3D measurement system</center>

<P>One person can set up Robotrak and perform a calibration within 30 minutes. Compared to other 
calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective.</P>
<p>The ability of Workspace to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak 
measuring units relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be 
mounted at any unknown position in the workcell.</P>
<p>The Robotrak measuring system consists of the following:-</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three Encoder Measuring Units incorporating 2500 pulses per revolution quadrature encoders. 
    Please note that because each encoder unit contains fragile precision components it should not 
    be dropped or treated roughly.
<LI>Three Calibration Fixtures (machined brass fork and steel locating plate assembly used for 
    accurately setting the cord exit point on the measuring unit).
<LI>A Robot Tool Flange Attachment Assembly for connection to the robot under test.
<LI>A 'Standard Length' Calibration Bar for accurately setting the encoder counts per millimetre.
<LI>An Encoder Interface Card for linking the Robotrak hardware to an IBM compatible PC.
<LI>Cables and connectors for use with above items.
<LI>A menu within Workspace used for setting up Robotrak, recording measurements, and performing
    robot calibration.
</UL>

<center>Calibration Fixture</center>

<center><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="calib6.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]"></IMG></center>
<center>Calibration Bar</center>


<p>The three encoder units are placed at the corners of an approximately equilateral triangle 
within the robot workcell. They may be mounted on the ground, on the ceiling, on a wall, or even 
on a fixture. They should be roughly 2 metres apart from each other, and must be fixed so that 
they will not move during the calibration.</P>
<P>A small, constant, restoring force is applied by each encoder unit to the measurement cord. As 
each Dynema cord is extended from the encoder unit a drum rotates and an encoder measures the 
rotation of the drum, thereby measuring the extension of the cord. A constant torque is applied 
to the drum by means of a torsional spring, thus tensioning the cord. The encoder counts, 
representing cord extension are passed to Workspace through the encoder interface card, which must 
be installed in the PC running Workspace.</P>
<P>The calibration bar is used during the setting up of Robotrak to determine the scaling factor 
of encoder counts to the cord extension in millimetres.</P>
<P>Once calibrated the Robotrak measuring units themselves then provide a convenient way of 
measuring the relative distance between each other. This is done by extending the cord from one 
unit to the next and accurately locating the cord attachment fitting in the calibration fixture 
of the next measuring unit: thus determining the distance between the two units. This procedure 
is repeated for all three units in turn operating in an anticlockwise direction.</P>
<P>When the set-up is complete, the robot may be calibrated. All three cords are fixed at a 
single point on the end of the robot tool or faceplate using the robot tool flange attachment 
assembly. By monitoring the extension of the cords Workspace can calculate the xyz position of 
the end of the robot tool, either when the robot is stationary or when it is moving.</P>

<h2>An overview of the Workspace calibration software</h2>

<P>Workspace makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is 
part of the Workspace system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to off-line programming. 
The software for the calibration is an integral part of Workspace and all the calibration options 
are available from Workspace menus.</P>
<P>The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system 
are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with 
discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration 
has been achieved.</P>
<P>Robot simulation, calibration, and off-line programming may therefore be seen as a seamless 
process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem 
as is often required during the cell design process.</P> 
<p>Errors which may be detected and modelled by Workspace and Robotrak include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint 
    variable is 0),
<LI>The length of each link and the distance offset at each link,
<LI>The orientation of each joint axis,
<LI>The compliance at each joint (each joint may be modelled as a torsional spring due to the 
    compliance in the gearing and transmission for the joint),
<LI>The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool and the tool axis 
    orientation,
<LI>The position and orientation of the measuring system co-ordinate frame relative to the robot 
    base co-ordinate frame.
</UL>
<P>Workspace extracts these errors from the physical measurements made by Robotrak and the 
teachpoints reported by the robot by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the 
measured characteristics. The Workspace kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. 
Points generated within Workspace during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter 
which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving 
to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different 
point.</P>
<P>It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical 
inadequacies.</P>
<P>With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain 
results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 
during off-line programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm.</P>
<P>Note that Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving 
along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. 
These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that 
generated during a simulation; thus giving a dynamic assessment capability.</P>

<h2>The Calibration Filter</h2>
<P>It is important to understand when and how the calibration filters are used. Otherwise 
confusion will arise as to the correctness of any display.</P>
<P>Teachpoints that are displayed on the screen are always unfiltered. The only situations where 
teachpoints pass through the filter are shown below.</P>
<P>The output filter is used when preparing points generated in the simulation for the robot in 
the following situations:-</P>
<UL>
<LI>During a Send to robot command when the track contains geometry points which are being 
    automatically converted to teachpoints;
<LI>Writing a position in a Jetware VR file at any time;
<LI>Converting a geometry point to a teachpoint using the Layout menu.
</UL>
<P>The input filter (which works in the opposite way to the output filter) is used as follows:-</P>
<UL>
<LI>During a Calibrate model menu command when three Datum teachpoints are imported from the 
    robot into the simulation.
<LI>During a Recalibrate tool menu command when four teachpoints are imported from the robot into 
    the simulation.
<LI>Reading a position from a Jetware VR file at any time.
<LI>Converting a teachpoint to a geometry point using the Layout menu.
</UL>

<h2>Installing the Robotrak interface card</h2>

<P>Before using Robotrak, the encoder interface card will need to be installed in the PC.</P>
<P>First of all, the PC must be disconnected from the mains and its cover removed. From above, 
the computer should look something like this.</P>

<center><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="calib7.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]"></IMG></center>
<center>PC motherboard</center>

<P>The encoder interface board is a half-length 8-bit card. To install it, an available 8-bit or 
16-bit slot must be found in the PC.</P>

<center><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="calib8.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]"></IMG></center>
<center>Installing the card</center>

<P>The blanking plate for the slot should be removed from the case of the PC, keeping the 
securing screw in a safe place.</P>
<P>The interface card should be aligned with the slot and pressed down until it is fully home.</P>
<P>The securing screw should be replaced so that the interface card is fixed into the PC.</P>

<P>Once the card is installed, the PC must be moved to a suitable position outside of the robot's 
envelope ready to connect up the encoder units.</P>

<h2>WARNING!</h2>
<P>It is important that the tension in the cords from the encoder units is maintained at all 
times. This is so that the cord will always wrap tightly around the drum. If the tension is not 
maintained the repeatability of Robotrak will be degraded. Therefore the cords should be moved 
slowly (at the speed of 'walking on the moon') when moving them towards the encoder unit.Always 
return the cords to the encoder units slowly.</P>

<h2>Installing the encoder units</h2>

<p>Now you can install the encoder units in the workcell, near the robot. Place the encoder units
 at the corners of an approximate equilateral triangle whose sides are roughly 2m in length. Bear 
in mind that when taking robot measurements using Robotrak the measured points should not be too 
close to the plane containing the encoder units, and that very large variations in the extension 
of one cord compared to the other cords should be avoided.  This should help you decide the 
optimum positions for the encoder units relative to the working volume of the robot.</P>
<P>Note that the encoders do not need to be mounted on the floor. The only configuration you must 
not use is to have the three encoder units in a line. Also, there must be a clear line of sight 
from one encoder unit to the next so that it is possible to use the cords to measure the distance 
between the units. The precise position of the encoders relative to the robot does not need to be 
known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning 
Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system.</P>
<P>When you have secured the encoder units, use the electrical cables supplied with them to 
connect the encoders to the interface card on the PC. Each plug is marked with the encoder units 
number, this should be inserted into the correspondingly marked port on the interface card.<b> N.B.</b> 
Care should be taken not to accidentally connect the 15 way 'density and a half' D-type plug from 
a VGA monitor into one of the input channels of the interface card as damage may result.</P>

<H2>WARNING!</h2>
<P>Whenever pulling a cord away from its base always grasp it firmly so that it does not slip, 
since the tension in the torsional spring will cause the cord to shoot back towards its base at 
high speed. This can damage the Robotrak components. For a similar reason, the cords should be 
checked every now and then for signs of breaking.</P>

<H2>The Workspace Robotrak Setup menu</h2>
<p>This menu is used to setup Robotrak. Issue each command in turn from the top to the bottom of 
the menu.</P>
<UL>

<LI>1. Run Workspace and go to the Options/Calibrate Robot sub-menu. Pull down the Robotrak setup 
sub-menu.
<LI>2. Use the Exact length of bar command to enter the number in mm written on the side of the 
calibration bar.
<LI>3. The aluminium attachment fittings should be at rest on top of each of the three encoder 
measuring units. This is the zero position for the cord. Use the Set all zero positions command. 
Answer yes to the question 'Are all the cords in their bases?'.
<LI>4. The repeatability of Robotrak depends to some extent on the repeatability of its zero 
position, which can be improved by allowing the zero position to 'settle'. Use the Check 
repeatabilities command. The readings from the three encoders are displayed on the screen. 
Initially the numbers will be red.
<P>Pull a cord away from its base (at least two metres) and then return the cord to the base and 
leave in the base for at least half a second. An audible click will be heard from the computer. 
If you do not hear a click then pull the cord out further. Do not pull the cord out too far - 
always leave a few winds of the cord on the drum (remove the cover of the encoder unit to see the 
drum if you are not sure). Repeat this until the displayed reading for the encoder turns from 
black to red. This will only happen after three consecutive zero readings for the cord have been 
with three encoder counts of each other.</P>
<P>Do this for all three cords (if there is more than one person available then the repeatability 
of all three cords can be checked at the same time by each parson working on one cord).</P>
<P>Once all three encoder readings have changed from red to black then press escape to exit. The 
encoders will be zeroed again.</P>
<LI>5. Now use the Set encoder length bar length for each base (timed). This command allows a 
single user to set each encoder bar length in turn in a single operation without assistance.
<P>When the command is called the user has 15 seconds to carefully place the wedge shaped end of 
the calibration bar flat against the cord exit point on the first encoder unit.  The cord should 
then be drawn out and the base of the aluminium attachment fitting allowed to rest in the slot at 
the other end of the calibration bar.</P>
<P>After 15 seconds a reading is taken and Workspace now calculates the scaling factor of encoder 
counts to length of extension in mm for that encoder unit. The user then has 15 seconds to repeat 
this operation for the second unit and a further 15 seconds for the third unit.</P>  
<LI>6. Use the Set distance for each base command.
<P>The use has the choice of finding the distances between all three bases one at a time or all 
together. It is recommended that the user finds the distances one at a time.</P>
<P>Find the two specified encoder units (they must always be numbered anticlockwise looking in 
"Plan" from the robot down onto the Robotrak units).</P>
<P>Take the calibration fixture (machined brass fork and steel locating plate) which has the 
same number as the second encoder unit. Insert the pin of the brass fitting into the plate if 
not already assembled. Insert the two locating pins from the steel plate into the top of the 
encoder unit near where the cord leaves the unit.</P>
<P>Extend the cord from the first unit to the second encoder unit with the calibration fixture, 
and place in the calibration fixture. Press escape next base. Workspace now calculates the 
distance between the two units.</P>
<P>Repeat for all three encoder units.</P>
7. Use the Continous cord reading command to inspect the readings from each encoder unit and check that they are now working correctly.

<h2>Connecting Robotrak to the robot</h2>
<UL>
<LI> Attach the robot tool flange attachment assembly to the robot tool flange (faceplate of the robot tool attachment point). This is usually done by means of four cap screws screwed into the robot tool flange. If the holes on your robot are not to the ISO Series 1 preferred sizes (e.g. Fanuc robots) then suitable holes will need to be drilled in the robot tool flange attachment assembly to align with these holes.
<LI> The aluminium attachment fittings at the end of each cord coming from the encoder units should be screwed onto the corresponding attachments on the cords coming from the robot tool flange attachment assembly.
<LI> Use a pair of calipers to measure the length from where the cord from the encoder unit enters the assembled aluminium attachment fittings to where cord from the robot enters the triple fitting on the robot tool flange attachment assembly. Enter the measured length of the top part of the cord in millimetres, after issuing the command Length of top part of cord 1. Repeat for cords 2 and 3.
</UL>

<h2>WARNING!</H2>
<P>When the Robotrak cords are connected to the robot the user should watch any robot movement to avoid the cords becoming entangled in the robot tool. The robot should always be moved slowly for this reason as well as to maintain the tension in the cords.</P>
<P>Always move the robot slowly.</P>

<UL>
<LI> Use the Continuous measurement reading command to display the xyz position of where the cords meet on the robot. Move the robot to check that this value changes as would be expected. The origin of the measurement system is at encoder unit 1, the x-axis is from unit 1 to unit 2. and the y-axis is at right angles to the x-axis in the plane of the 3 units, on the unit 3 side of the x-axis. The z-axis is perpendicular to the x,y plane and passes through the origin.
</UL>
<center><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="calib9.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]"></IMG></center>
<center>The Robotrak Co-ordinate Frame</center>

<h2>Recording a set of calibration measurements</h2>
<UL>
<LI> Make a note of the tool frame, as well as the robot base frame as reported on the controller. The tool offset can be nil during calibration, or any value ( as long as that value is noted down). It is probably easiest if both the tool and the base frame are nil.
<P>The true physical tool offset values are parameters that will revealed as part of the calibration process.</P>
<LI> Teach 50 different positions and orientations throughout the robot's working envelope using the robot teach pendant. These positions and orientations should vary as widely as possible throughout the robot envelope. Remember always to move the robot slowly when the Robotrak cords are connected (see above warning). If creating a program to cycle through the positions a pause of at least one second should be inserted between subsequent moves (this is particularly important when using with the Auto-record feature of Workspace). Workspace can calibrate a robot with 25 positions, however more points give greater accuracy in the calibration.
<P>When teaching the points it is recommended that the plane of the end connector where the cords meet is kept at the same angle to the cords in all the recorded positions. Or to put it another way the average vector of the cords should be the same as the approach vector of the tool. So if all the cords are forming a roughly 30 degree angle to the vertical (a fairly extreme position) then the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is at 90 degrees to all the cords, or (imagining a two cord Robotrak) if one cord is roughly horizontal and the other is roughly vertical that the tool should be rotated so that the end of the connector is 45 degrees to both.</P>
<LI>Use the Check teachpoints suitable command to check the suitability of the teachpoints.
<LI>There are two methods available within Workspace to take the readings from Robotrak. The Record Robotrak measurements command on the Robotrak special options menu requires input from the user when Workspace is required to take a measurement.
<P>The Auto-record Robotrak measurements command automatically senses when a reading should be taken, and is the recommended method.</P>
<P>Write a robot programme to move to each teachpoint in turn, pausing at the point for at least a second. Start the robot program.  Workspace will then take readings whenever the readings from Robotrak settle for 0.5 of a second. Pressing escape or a mouse button will terminate the process.</P>
<P>The measurements are stored in a file with the extension EXT.</P>
</UL>

<h2>Running the robot calibration software</h2>
<UL>
<LI>Load the model containing the robot that is to be calibrated into Workspace. 
<LI>Set the robot model tool frame and base frame to the same values as were noted from the robot controller.
<LI>Use the Simulate/Simulate options/Teachpoint file option to select the teachpoint file that was used to record the measurement file.
<LI> Use the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Extract errors from measurements command. This will compare the teachpoint file and the measurement file and find the errors in the robot structure and the relative position of Robotrak and the robot that would have created the values in the files. This should take about 30 seconds, depending on the speed of the PC.
</UL>

<H2>Interpreting the Calibration search data</H2>
<P>Several pages of data are generated during execution of the Extract errors from measurements command.</P>
<H3>PAGE 1</h3>
<p>The search to find errors in the robot model has two stages: searching for the approximate position and orientation of the measuring system and the approximate physical tool offset, then searching for all kinematic and compliance errors (this final stage also finds the exact position and orientation of the measuring system and the exact physical tool offset).</p>
<P>The first stage is necessary to find good initial values for some of the variables that we are seeking in the final stage. Good initial values ensure that the search finds the correct local minimum.</P>
<P>During each stage the following lines are displayed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stage: (the current stage of the search)
<LI>Iteration: (the number of iterations in this stage of the search so far)
<LI>Error: (the average positional error between the end of the robot calculated using the robot model and the measurements taken by Robotrak).
</UL>
<P>At the end of the two stages the error displayed on the screen gives a measure of the accuracy of the calibration in millimetres.</P>
<h3>PAGE 2</h3>
<P>The kinematic errors detected during the search are now formally displayed. First the modified DH parameters are displayed along with the tool offset and the position and orientation of the co-ordinate frame at joint 1 relative to the measuring system co-ordinate frame, then the errors between the modified values and the uncalibrated robot model are displayed.</P>
<P>Finally the statement 'The error between the positions measured and the reported positions may be reduced as follows by changing the kinematics of the model' is followed by the average and maximum errors without the modifications, and the average and maximum errors with the modifications. It is these values that are of greatest importance in deciding if the calibration has been successful. Many applications require the error in the position of the tool to be within a certain value relative to the position demanded by the off-line programming system.</P>
<P>It should be remembered when interpreting these values that they refer to the absolute accuracy. Many applications require only relative accuracy, for example machining a piece of metal. Many other applications can be made to rely on relative accuracy by careful design of the workcell. Because the remaining errors are often systematic in nature the relative accuracy can often be considerably better than the absolute accuracy. For a similar reason, the accuracy can be improved by restricting the movement of the robot to a small volume within the overall envelope.</P>
<P>The user has the option of saving the results as a bitmap.</P>
<H3>PAGES 3 and 4</h3>
<P>Histograms showing the spread of the positional errors before and after calibration are displayed. This gives useful information that cannot be obtained by looking at the average and maximum values alone.</P>

<P>The user may decide on the basis of the results obtained either to use the results to modify the existing robot model or to discard the results. If the user decides to modify the existing model then the user may also decide whether or not to use a filter to modify any teachpoints that are generated using the calibrated robot model so that they may be used on the uncalibrated robot (note that calibration calibrates the robot model not the robot itself).</P>
<P>When a calibrated model is being used then 'Calibrated' will also be displayed above the robots name. 
At the end of the calibration Workspace will display a model of the Robotrak cords going from each measuring unit to the endpoint of the robot. This may be turned off by using the Options/Calibrate using Robotrak/Robotrak special options/Turn Robotrak off command.</P>

<h2>How the calibrated robot model is used</h2>
<P>The calibration results are used to improve the simulated robot model so that it matches more exactly the way that the real robot moves. Any joint-co-ordinate teachpoints which are subsequently generated off-line on the simulation may then be downloaded to the robot controller and the robot will move to the position that is required. However, it is important to understand that the robot controller has no knowledge of the errors in its understanding of the real robots kinematics. Therefore, before Cartesian co-ordinate teachpoints are downloaded to the robot controller the simulation must somehow fool the robot into moving to the true position that we require by asking it to move to another slightly different position.</P> 
<P>For example: Suppose that we wish the end of the robot tool to move to the xyz position 1000,1000,1000. If we ask the robot to move to this position it might move to 1002,1001,1001. Instead, we ask the robot to move to 998,999,999. The robot then moves to what it thinks is 998,999,999 but which is in reality 1000,1000,1000.</P>
<P>To fool the robot into going to the correct Cartesian teachpoint positions we pass every geometry point through a filter before writing it to a teachpoint file. Similarly, when a teachpoint is loaded from a teachpoint file and converted to a geometry point it passes through the reverse filter (see above).</P>
<h2>Recalibrating tool values</h2>
<p>Options on the Options/Recalibrate tool sub menu can be used to correct  tool information after damage has occured. The commands are intended for use by users who damage the tool, perhaps bending it slightly due to a collision, and need to know the new tool offset and orientation without using robotrak. It can also be used to calibrate the tool precisely if it was not possible to place the three cords accurately at the end of the tool during the calibration procedure.</p>
<p>The commands can be more accurate than the same methods used on robot controllers because they make full use of the calibrated robot model, if such a model is available.</P>
<P>Note that it is not necessary to use these commands if the correct tool offset and orientation have already been identified using Robotrak and no collision or tool alteration has occured.</P>
<P>To recalibrate the tool offset the following must be done. Move the real robot to a point which is fixed in the workcell and save the point as a teachpoint in a new teachpoint file. Change the orientation of the robot and move the robot to the same point, again save the teachpoint. Repeat this several times for diferent orientations around the same point sacving each in the teach point file (at least 4 are required and it is recommended that the teachpoint orientations are varied considerably - see the Recalibrate tool menu for more information).Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate tool offset command. Workspace will use the robot model to calculate the tool offset.</P>
<P>The tool offset must be recalibrated before the x and z axis are recalibrated.</P>
<P>To recalibrate the x-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool x-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate x-axis command.</P>
<P>To recalibrate the z-axis, move the robot in the direction of the tool y-axis away from the point used in the recalibrate tool offset command to another point and save that point as a teachpoint. Then issue the Recalibrate tool/Recalibrate z-axis command.</P>
<P>Note that the recalibrate tool menu commands will give more accurate tool values if the robot is first calibrated.</P>

<h2>Calibrating the tool orientation</h2> 
<p>Once a robot has been calibrated then Robotrak may be used to find the tool orientation. At the end of a successful calibration remove the standard Robotrak tool attachment and replace it with an identical assembly designed by the user in which the point at which the three cords meet has been moved a short distance along a direction parallel to the desired tool z axis. Then use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Calibrate tool z-axis command. Workspace calculates from this an appropriate tool orientation. A similar procedure may be used with the calibrate tool x-axis command.</P>

<H2>Calibrating the workcell fixtures</h2> 
<p>Once the robot has been calibrated and its off-line programming accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot (note that the xyz offset of the end of the robot tool or pointer must be found beforehand - possibly by using the Recalibrate tool offset command). This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the off-line generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method of measuring the position of fixtures is by disconnecting Robotrak from the robot and moving Robotrak to several points on the fixture (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted by Workspace so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). This however, requires the use of an additional stylus unit fitted to Robotrak in place of the robot tool flange attachment assembly. A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense.</P>
<P>Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to generate accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures.</P>
<p>Two commands are available within Workspace that aid workcell set-up.</P> 
<p>The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition object using 3 points command can be used to accurately place an object relative to the robot. The method for using this command is as follows. 3 geometry points should be created on the object at known location on the object, the geometry points must be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Using the robot, teachpoints should be created relative to the object in the workcell at the same positions on the object as the teachpoints, again these need to be named DATUM1, DATUM2 and DATUM3. Workspace can then match  the geometry points to the teachpoints thus positioning the object correctly relative to the robot.</P>
<p>The command Options/Calibrate model/Reposition robot using 3 points command, has a similar effect as the Reposition object using 3 points command. Except in this case the object remains fixed and the robot is repositioned.</p> 

<h2>Recording robot trajectories using Robotrak</h2>
<p>Robotrak may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path to check the accuracy of paths generated by the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using Workspace and compared with that generated during a simulation.</P>
<p>Use the Options/Calibrate robot/Robotrak special options/Record trajectory command to start recording a trajectory using Robotrak. At the end of the recording the trajectory is displayed on the screen. The relative position of this trajectory will only be correct if Workspace already knows the position of Robotrak (the robot calibration process derives this from the calibration measurements and teachpoints).</P>
<p>Use the Simulate/Replay track and log trajectory command to log a trajectory of a robot moving along a path specified by the track file. At the end of this command the trajectory is displayed and may be compared with that recorded using Robotrak from the real robot.</P>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<P>Problems with the repeatability of the encoder zero positions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the Continuous cord reading reports larger than expected differences (more than 20) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the cord is not wrapping tightly around the drum. There may also be a problem if the cord starts to overlap the cord already wrapped around the drum - remove the unit side cover and this will be immediately apparent.
<P>The cord should be extended and then returned to the drum very slowly so that the tension is maintained enabling the cord to wrap neatly and tightly around the drum.</P>
<P>The very first couple of times the cord wraps around the drum care should be taken to avoid overlapping - if necessary guide the cord using a finger. In normal operation of Robotrak this is not necessary because the cord never becomes completely unwound from the drum.</p>
<LI>If the Continuous cord reading reports large differences (more than 1000) in the values reported when the cord is at the zero position (where the value ideally should be zero) then this suggests that the interface card may be faulty and further advice should be sought from the supplier.
</UL>
<P>Problems with obtaining calibration results:</P>
If the Extract errors from measurements command returns robot calibration results which report an average error after calibration, of over 3mm, or if the search does not finish and no results are reported, there may be several possible causes.
<UL>
<LI>Problems with obtaining average errors less than 3mm may be caused by bad repeatability of the encoder zero positions (see above).
<LI>It may be that the robot model is not performing the inverse kinematics correctly. Check that the Cartesian positions and corresponding joint co-ordinates reported on the robot controller are the same as the Cartesian position and joint co-ordinates reported by the simulated robot model. If there are any discrepancies then fax these to Robot Simulations who will correct your robot model.
<LI>If the point where Robotrak is attached to the robot or the encoder measuring units are moved slightly during the calibration then it will invalidate the measurement data. Make certain that everything is securely fixed and cannot move during robot motion.
<LI>The robot world frame and the tool frame on the robot controller and on Workspace may be different. If the teachpoint file used with the robot stores the teachpoints as Cartesian (xyz and orientation) values rather than joint angles then these teachpoints will only be interpreted by Workspace correctly if Workspace uses the same robot world frame and tool frame as was used on the robot controller when the points were recorded.
<P>Note that the true physical tool offset will be calculated by Workspace as part of the calibration so it is not important that the tool frame on the robot controller matches the physical length of the tool.</P>
<LI>It is possible that the non-geometric errors in the real robot are more significant than expected. This is unlikely with most standard industrial revolute robots.

<H1>Robot calibration - Questions and answers</H1>
</HEAD>

<H2>What is robot calibration?</H2>
<P>Robot calibration is a means whereby a robot can be made to move more accurately to a given xyz position and orientation by creating an improved mathematical model of the robot kinematics.</P>

<H2>What is the difference between accuracy and repeatability?</H2>
<P>It is important that we understand the difference between accuracy and repeatability. Repeatability is a measure of the ability to move back to the same position over and over again, whereas accuracy is the ability to move to a given position. As an analogy, consider somebody throwing darts at a board. If all the darts go into roughly the same place then the repeatability is good, though it may not be the position that the thrower was aiming at, in which case the accuracy would be bad. If all the darts hit the position the thrower was aiming at then the accuracy and the repeatability are good.</P>

<H2>Which physical errors cause robots to be inaccurate?</H2>
<P>The difference between the physical joint zero position of the robot and the zero position reported by the robot controller usually has the biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. Common sense suggests that errors in the zero position of joints 1, 2, and 3 will have a bigger effect on the robot positional error than joints 4, 5, and 6. We can ignore the effect of joint 1 since it is compensated for using the model calibration (see later). Additionally, experience suggests that joint 2 and 3 often have the largest zero position error because at some point in the robot's life it will have been crashed into the floor - throwing out the zero position by up to a degree.</P>
<P>The error in the robot zero position is often responsible for 90% of the robot positional error.</P>
<P>The length of the robot links usually has the second biggest effect on the robot's accuracy. When the links are manufactured there is inevitably some variation in their dimensions from one robot to the next, as well as a variation in the orientation of the joints. Within each robot controller is a mathematical model of the robot which assumes that the links on one robot are the same length as the links on another robot of the same type, and that the relative orientations of the joints on one robot are the same as on another robot of the same type.</P>
<P>This is not true, and this causes the robot to estimate incorrectly where its endpoint is given a set of joint angles.</P>
<P>It is unlikely on most industrial robots that the variation in link lengths would be more than a couple of millimetres.</P>
<P>The next most significant factor in the robot positional error is joint compliance. This may be though of as factor representing the torsional spring effect at each joint which responds to the effect of gravity each link.</P>

<H2>How are these physical errors represented?</H2>
<P>The robot kinematic structure is often represented by mathematicians using DH parameters. These are simply a compact representation of the position and orientation of each joint relative to the previous joint.</P>
<P>There are four numbers for each joint: d, a, theta, and alpha.</P>
<P>D and a represent distances and theta and alpha represent angles.</P>
<P>Joint zero errors for a rotational joint are stored as theta values.</P>
<P>Link length and distance offset errors are stored as d and a values.</P>
<P>Relative joint orientation errors are stored as alpha values.</P>
<P>An additional parameter beta is introduced for two joints which are parallel to represent any slight misalignment.</P>

<H2>Why do we calibrate robots for offline programming but not for teach-pendant programming?</H2>
<P>Most robots are designed to be very repeatable (typically within 0.1mm) but have a low accuracy (typically between 5 and 15mm). The robot-programmer using a teach-pendant is not usually concerned with the accuracy of the robot, only its repeatability.
Consider a spot-welding workcell. The user uses the teach-pendant and his eye to guide the robot to a chalk mark on the metal parts where the spot-weld is to be placed. The user doesn't care whether this xyz position is (1500,800,700) or (1505,795,695). He/she will only be concerned that when he looks at the robot tool that it looks as though it is close to the chalk mark.</P>
<P>However, if the same robot programme is written offline using a geometric model of the part to define the spot-welds then the accuracy of the robot will become very important, since it is only the numbers from the offline programme which define the robot movement and there is no visual correction by the robot-programmer.</P>
<P>By calibrating the robot before downloading a robot programme written offline it might therefore be possible to avoid the need to touch up the teachpoints visually using the teach pendant.</P>

<H2>Is there an alternative to calibrating the robot?</H2>
<P>Yes. Instead of calibrating the robot to improve the accuracy of the offline programmed points the robot-programmer can use the teach-pendant to touch up the points. Since the robot positional error for an uncalibrated robot is at worst of the order of 15mm then all that is required to correct the programme is jogging each teachpoint using the teach-pendant a very small distance until the point looks to be correct.</P>

<H2>How long does robot calibration take?</H2>
<P>The first stage of robot calibration is to take the necessary measurements of the robot position for a number of teachpoints. If the teachpoints have been previously defined then the whole process of placing a Robotrak measurement device in a workcell, performing the set-up procedure for Robotrak, and recording measurements for 50 teachpoints takes about 30 minutes.</P>
<P>The teachpoint file and the measurements can then be used within Workspace running on a PC to procedure a calibrated model within a few seconds.</P>

<H2>When is robot calibration cost-effective?</H2>
<P>Robot calibration is cost-effective when touching up offline programmed teachpoints is undesirable for some reason.</P>
<P>It may be that the act of touching up points manually introduces an undesirable element of subjective judgment into an otherwise objective Computer Integrated Manufacturing environment. The overall accuracy of the position in a robotic workcell which uses a robot programme generated offline would in this situation be dependent on the accuracy of the robot programmer, which would inevitably vary with fatigue and ability. This is the justification used by many car companies to justify calibration of all the robots on an offline programmed re-spot line.</P>

<H2>When is robot calibration not necessary?</H2>
<P>Robot calibration is not required for teach-pendant programming of a robot (unless the poor accuracy of the robot has a significant effect on the quality of linear and circular trajectories).</P>
<P>Robot calibration might not be necessary where the working volume of the robot is very small. The robot can be said to have a good relative accuracy over this small volume.
Robot calibration might also be unnecessary if the robot is very accurate before calibration. A good test of the accuracy of the robot is the quality of the tool calibration performed using a fixed pointer and several teachpoints with different orientations. This figure is reported by the Workspace Recalibrate tool command.</P>

<H2>What methods for calibrating robots exist?</H2>
<P>Any 3d measurement system can be used to obtain measurements which are subsequently used to create a calibrated robot model. Workspace uses its own Robotrak three-cord measurement device (accurate to within 0.2mm), but other devices can also be used with Workspace such as the Leica Smart automatic theodolite (which has an accuracy measured in microns).</P>
<P>There is even a method for calibrating robots that does not use a measurement device but instead moves the robot to a fixed pointer using different orientations (similar to the standard method for calibrating tools) though its accuracy is not as good as that measurement based calibrations.</P>

<H2>How does robot calibration work?</H2>
<P>Most methods of robot calibration work by comparing teachpoint positions for a robot to measurements of the end of the tool relative to an independent 3d measuring device. A search method is used to find which changes in the mathematical model of the robot would allow the distance between where the robot thinks it is and where the robot actually is to be minimised. The search method is contained within the Workspace software and the Workspace robot model is updated with the changes.</P>

<H2>Where is the calibration data stored?</H2>
<P>The calibration data obtained using Workspace is stored in the model of the robot and the workcell. To use this robot in a different workcell without recalibrating it is only necessary to use the calibrated robot model. Note that the robot controller and the robot itself have no knowledge of the fact that Workspace has calibrated the robot.</P>

<H2>What is the difference between remastering and robot calibration?</H2>
<P>Remastering is where the position of each joint at which it reports itself as being zero is changed so that it coincides with the physical zero position of the joint. Some robots (for example the Fanus S10) use a special fixture to define the robot physical zero position. Other robots use a mark on each link to define the robot physical zero position. To remaster the robot the user jogs the robot using the teach-pendant to the physical zero position for each joint and then issues a command to the robot controller to use this position as the new zero position.</P>
<P>This improves the accuracy of the robot in a similar way to robot calibration, though robot calibration goes further in that it not only corrects errors in the zero position but also in the link lengths and offsets. Therefore robot calibration should provide slightly better accuracy than remastering.</P>

<H2>Is remastering the robot an alternative to robot calibration?</H2>
<P>Yes, if the user is able to remaster the robot accurately and if the small additional accuracy provided by robot calibration is not required.</P>
<P>Remastering a robot will frequently improve the accuracy of offline programming in the same way that robot calibration will. However, remastering will make any existing robot programmes on the robot controller no longer accurate, unlike robot calibration which does not change the parameters of the robot controller.</P>
<P>In some situations the user may wish to use robot calibration to suggest changes to the robot zero position to be used in remastering.</P>

<H2>Why don't robot manufacturers calibrate their robots?</H2>
<P>Most industrial robot manufactures remaster their robots before they leave the factory. This effectively removes errors in the joint zero positions. However, it is very rare that a robot manufacturer calibrates to compensate for the true link lengths of each individual robot.</P>
<P>Traditional method of programming are teach-pendant based and do not require robots to be calibrated. As more and more users start to use offline methods which require calibrated robots then it is likely that the maufacturers will place a greater emphasis on calibrating the robot before it is shipped to the customer.</P>
<P>Once the robot is installed in a production environment it is likely that it will suffer collisions which will cause the joints to loose their accuracy, so that robot calibration will again be required.</P>

<H2>What is the difference between a three-point touch and robot calibration?</H2>
<P>Three-point touch is a term used to describe model calibration. The robot is used as a measuring device to determine where the fixture is relative to the robot by touching three datum points on the fixture. These points are then brought back into the simulation model of the workcell and used to update the position of the model of the fixture in the simulation.</P>
<P>Though the three-point touch does correct for any errors in the zero position of joint 1 it does not correct for any other factors influencing the robot's accuracy. Therefore it may be that for some workcells all that is  required is a three-point touch whereas for other workcells a robot calibration and a three-point touch is required.</P>

<H2>What is tool calibration?</H2>
<P>Tool calibration is the process whereby the true xyz offset from the mounting faceplate of the robot to the end of the tool may be found. It is important that the correct offset is used in the offline simulation so that robot programme it generates is accurate on the real robot.</P>
<P>Some applications require that the orientation of the tool should also be found.</P>

<H2>How can tools be calibrated?</H2>
<P>Some robot controllers allow a user to calibrate a tool by moving its tip to the end of a fixed pointer in several different orientations. Workspace uses the same method for its Recalibrate tool command, though it can obtain more accurate tool offsets than the robot controller because it can use a calibrated robot model (if a robot calibration has been performed previously).</P>
<P>In some situations the Robotrak measuring device may be fitted to the tip of the tool. This allows Workspace to calibrate the robot and the tool in one step.</P>

<H2>Does tool and model calibration require use of a measuring system?</H2>
<P>Neither tool nor model calibration require use of a measuring system.</P>

<H2>How does calibration and offline programming all fit together</H2>
<P>To understand how these techniques all fit together here is a description of several differing offline programming sequences.</P>
<P>A) Calibration of the robot and the tool in one step.</P>
<P>The measuring device is attached to the end of the tool. This will only be possible if the end of the tool is easily accessible.</P>
<P>1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell.</P>
<P>2. The robot and tool are calibrated in one step (by moving the robot to 50 teachpoints and taking a measurement at each step).</P>
<P>3. The model is calibrated (by moving the robot so that the tip of its tool touches each of three datum points in turn) and the fixture repositioned within the simulation.</P>
<P>4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.</P>
<P>B) Calibration of the robot and tool in separate steps.</P>
<P>In this situation the measuring device is attached to a point on the tool which is accessible but which is not the end of the tool.</P>
<P>1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell.</P>
<P>2. The robot is calibrated.</P>
<P>3. The tool is calibrated.</P>
<P>4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation.</P>
<P>5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.</P>
<P>C) Use of a special pointer tool for model calibration</P>
<P>In this situation the tool is unwieldy and so we replace it during robot and model calibration with a special pointer tool.</P>
<P>1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell.</P>
<P>2. The special pointer tool is attached to the robot. The robot and the special pointer tool are calibrated in one step.</P>
<P>3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation.</P>
<P>4. Special pointer tool is removed from the robot and replaced with the real tool.</P>
<P>5. The tool is calibrated.</P>
<P>6. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.</P>
<P>D) No robot calibration</P>
<P>Here we assume that the robot is relatively accurate over the its working volume in the workcell.</P>
<P>1. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell.</P>
<P>2. The tool is calibrated.</P>
<P>3. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation.</P>
<P>4. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.</P>
<P>E) Remastering of the robot</P>
<P>Suppose that offline programming has been attempted without robot calibration and that the robot was found to be inaccurate. The robot is then remastered.</P>
<P>1. The robot is remastered using the manufacturer's remastering procedure.</P>
<P>2. A path is generated in the simulation using the model of the workcell.</P>
<P>3. The tool is calibrated.</P>
<P>4. The model is calibrated and the fixture repositioned within the simulation.</P>
<P>5. The path is sent to the robot as a robot programme.</P>

<H1>Offline Programming and Robot Calibration - The Car Industry</H1> 

<P>The major users of robots have traditionally been the car companies whose product is unique in that starts as  a mass produced sheet of metal whose complexity requires intensive and advanced automation techniques with a short set-up time.</P>

<P>In North America the 'big three' car makers are Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Based in Detroit and elsewhere in the continent these companies have spent the past five years investing heavily in robot simulation and offline programming. The urgency exerted by an unexpected demand for the most popular models as well as a large upturn in consumer spending on cars has created a pressure-cooker atmosphere in Detroit. Here production lines are designed and built and running in weeks or months and every offline programming technique is examined closely for potential improvements in set-up time or production rate.</P>

<P>One of the major issues here is the move towards more and more accurate spot and arc welding techniques. The 2mm car (where every robot weld is within 2mm of the intended position on every car that rolls of the production line) is talked of as a kind of Holy Grail of car production - and some people even talk in hushed tones of eventually pushing the barrier even further to achieve the 1mm car. This has focused attention on those techniques, especially robot calibration and fixture calibration, that will lead to a higher accuracy of offline programming.</P>

<P>Current practice involves several stages from simulation to offline programming. First the car is modelled in the company-wide CAD system, often a sophisticated mainframe based CAD package like CATIA which can handle models of the complete car and all the parts that make up the car. Then the fixtures are designed which are to present the parts to the welding robots in a repeatable and predictable manner.</P>

<P>It is usually a requirement that the fixtures, which are created by specialist tooling companies under contract, are 'certified'. This means that points on the fixture which are to clamp the part, or the blocks against which the part are clamped, must be measured very precisely using a 3-d co-ordinate measuring device. These measurements are referred to a co-ordinate frame on the centreline of the car using three datum points on the fixture. These three datum points give the position (x, y, z,), orientation (a, b, c), and scaling factor associated with the fixture.</P>

<P>The measurements are usually recorded using two manual theodolites and standard theodolite triangulation.</P>
<P>Another alternative technique that promises even higher accuracies than those achieved using theodolites is named photogrammetry. Photogrammetry uses several very high resolution electronic 'photographs' of a target attached to the fixture taken from different angles together with standard image-processing techniques to derive the 3-d position of the target. It has a technique that has long been used in terrain mapping using aerial photography and advanced stereo vision but is only now finding an application down on the shop floor.</P>

<P>The first fixture is then installed on the production line, and from this the position of the first robot is defined, again using theodolites. The position of the first fixture then defines the position of the second fixture, and so on, all the way down the production line.</P>

<P>The simulation of the robot programmes has usually been completed by this stage using models imported from the CAD system and off-the-shelf robot models purchased from the simulation vendor. More and more of the simulation functionality is available on the CAD system: for example co-ordinate frames representing the position and orientation of spot-welds and approach points and 'weld-schedules' indicating the motion type and speed between points can be defined in CATIA before exporting the model to the simulation.</P>

<P>The simulation is used to check that the robots can reach all the required positions. The wrist joint limits of the robot often limit the orientations that are achievable and the simulation user must work creatively to position the robot base and the robot tool. A particular position and orientation may not be achievable in a given robot configuration, for example with the wrist pointing down or with the elbow pointing up. The configuration of the robot model can be changed by driving the robot using joint motion into a different configuration before attempting the movement.</P>

<P>The simulation enables the user to plan collision free paths around the clamps holding the part using via points which must be created in such a way that they do not add excessively to the overall cycle time. This is the reason that is so important to derive reasonably accurate cycle times from the simulation. Unfortunately, the robot companies consider the motion algorithms used by their robot controllers to be of such commercial value that they will always refuse to release these to the simulation vendors. A compromise position has been reached between the simulation vendors and the robot vendors (thanks to the strong encouragement of the car companies in America and in Germany) where 'black boxes' (unreadable parts of the robot controller software) are interfaced to the robot simulation to give accurate cycle times. Once the cycle times are accurate the user may also have reasonable confidence that the trajectories between points shown by the simulation are accurate, and therefore that the collision and near-miss information provided by the simulation is reliable - a key issue if simulation is to be trusted by those on the shop-floor.</P>

<P>Downloading the robot programmes (sometimes called 'tracks') from the simulation to the robot controller involves taking a disc containing the programme, teachpoint, and tool frame files from the air-conditioned offices where the CAD and simulation specialist work down onto the much harsher and unforgiving environment of the factory. It is here that most advocates of simulation and offline have a rude awakening. Programmes that work fine in the 'virtual reality' environment of the robot simulation seldom work in the uncertain and unpredictable and subtly different real world.</P>

<P>Robots are designed to be extremely repeatable but not all that accurate (repeatabilities of 0.1mm and accuracies of 10mm or worse are not unusual). To understand the difference between repeatability and accuracy imagine a darts game. The first player is playing with new darts and so aims for a triple 20 but instead puts all the darts in the number 6, with all three darts close together. The darts are repeatable but not very accurate. The second darts player, playing with his own tried and tested set of darts, throws three treble 20s. His darts are not only repeatable, but they are also accurate. To increase the accuracy of the robot towards the same order as its repeatability it must be calibrated. Each robot has its own individual signature created by the manufacturing tolerances involved in making robots and by the wear and tear of crashing the robot into fixtures (an all to regular occurrence) and worse. This signature can be detected by measuring the 3d co-ordinates of the robot over a range of positions and orientations throughout its envelope and then using calibration software to produce a more accurate custom model of the robot.</P>

<P>The measuring devices used on the shop floor for robot calibration must be cheap and relatively easy and quick to use, since up to 50 measurements may be required for each robot. Robotrak consist of three drums which may be placed anywhere in the workcell from which three cords are extended to meet at the endpoint of the robot. The length of the cord is indicated by the rotation of the drum, and from the three lengths the x, y, z position of the endpoint of the robot may be calculated and recorded to within a repeatability of 0.3mm. If a higher accuracy is required then a laser-tracker named Smart may be used. Smart is the next generation of theodolite: it tracks targets automatically without any manual intervention. The key to Smart is a laser interferometer that measures distance very precisely so that together with the two angles representing the direction that Smart is pointing itself it is possible to calculate the x, y, z position of a point instead of having to use 2 conventional theodolites and triangulation. Smart is accurate to about 0.025mm though this degrades to 0.050mm under shop floor conditions of temperature change, vibration, and large vehicles trundling past. Robot Simulations Ltd, who offer Robotrak and Smart for use with their Workspace robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming software suggest that customers requiring accuracies circa. 1mm should use Robotrak, while customers requiring accuracies much lower than 1mm should use Smart.</P>

<P>Once the robot has been calibrated it can be used with a pointer of known length as an accurate measuring device to record the position of the fixture datum points. This '3-point touch-up' is often mistaken for robot calibration, but is really only used for positioning the model of the fixture correctly relative to the robot model within the simulation and thereby avoiding one of the pitfalls of offline programming.</P>

<P>Finally, the correct tool offset must be defined on the robot controller and on the robot simulation. If the dimensions of the tool are well known then this is a straightforward process, but if the tool dimensions are unknown or if the tool is slightly bent because of a collision that has occurred on the shop floor then a tool calibration must be carried out. </P>

<P>The robot programme created by the simulation is really only ready for downloading to the robot once all the above procedures are complete.</P>

<P>If one of these steps is ignored or badly implemented then the resulting programme can be anything from 2 inches to a foot out, depending on the seriousness of the mistakes involved. This is where most of the horror stories involving robot simulation and offline programming originate: 'we took a programme from .... and downloaded it to the robot and the robot drove straight into the fixture' or 'we created 120 offline programmes for the whole production line and not one worked first time - they all needed to be touched up by hand'.</P>

<P>The final source of error in offline programming is a simple logistic one: by the time the simulation is finished and ready for offline programming the real workcell may been redesigned, turntables have been introduced or removed, additional robots have been inserted. Only now its too late to go back and simulate because the simulation office is working on simulations for the next production line. The simplest way to avoid this situation is to make certain of the following:</P>

<P>1. One person is responsible for the simulation from start to finish (the finish being when the production line is up and running smoothly and there are no more changes);</P>

<P>2. The simulation goes down onto the shop floor with the offline programme where last minute changes can be immediately introduced into the simulation. Microcomputer based robot simulation packages which can run on notebooks mean that nobody has an excuse for leaving the simulation up in the design office instead of taking it down onto the shop floor where it is really needed.</P>

<P>So with all these potential pitfalls and inaccuracies in robot simulation and offline programming, is it really worth attempting? If you want the answer, come to Detroit. The car companies will not spend money on any technology that doesn't produce savings that can be measured in Dollars and Cents, and they see robot simulation and offline programming as the revolutionary technology that will enable them to build more cars, quicker and at a lower cost than ever before. What the Big Three are using today, the rest of us in manufacturing will be implementing tomorrow.</P>

</HEAD>

<H2>March 1995</H2>

<P>Robot Simulations was formed in 1989, by Dr. John Owens, to bring to the market a software system called WORKSPACE. This product group is the result of research carried out by John Owens for his Ph.D. in Robotics, Simulation, Advanced Languages and Control.</P>

<P>The first version to be introduced was WORKSPACE 1.0, which was the first 3D robot simulation to run on a PC, in the world. As with all new products feedback from customers was essential in identifying possible areas of improvement, leading to, in 1991, the release of WORKSPACE 2.0. This received much greater recognition within the robotics establishment and was gradually accepted  within higher education and industry as a valuable teaching, training and learning tool.</P>

<P>Robot Simulations Limited (RSL) was incorporated in December 1992, when Roger Verrall came in as Managing Director, allowing John Owens to concentrate on finalising WORKSPACE 3.0. This is a product for industry as well as education. The features that were incorporated brought PC based software ever closer to workstation systems as a very much more cost effective alternative. Full factory lay-outs with unlimited number of robots and mechanisms can be designed, calibrated, simulated and programmed, as one model. Apart from robot and model calibration there is inverse kinematics, robot languages, over 100 industrial and educational robot models, DXF/IGES interface, 3D graphics in SuperVGA (256 colours), computer aided learning files all on a standard modern PC. This increases the number of companies who can now afford to automate, without incurring the high cost of workstation hardware/software.</P>

<P>In July 1994 RSL linked with Robot Dynamics to market the Robotrak measuring system. This is an electro-mechanical set of units that can when linked with WORKSPACE 3+ (latest version) produce accurate calibration for off-line programming. This process is the subject of a patent application.</P>

<P>RSL is based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has a policy of employing graduates with either computing or engineering disciplines. With increased staff levels, the ongoing development of the new WORKSPACE versions and other systems is well underway. To keep ahead of the field RSL develops products of quality with speed. The emphasis on quality and customer support has led to RSL doubling its turnover each year to reach 6 figures in just 3 years.</P>

<P>Sales have increased to UK. colleges and export markets on each continent. The Japanese and the USA have recognised the value of PC based simulation systems and development work is underway with major blue chip companies worldwide. Experience has shown the value of good agents with ability to recognise the value of WORKSPACE in the long term, not for the quick return.</P>

<P>RSL is a totally independent company, with no outside shareholders or venture capital. WORKSPACE is an in-house development, suitable for both robot manufacturers and users, each receiving equal service and confidentiality.</P>

<TITLE>Robot and Fixture Calibration for Offline Programming</TITLE> 
<H1>Robot and Fixture Calibration for Offline Programming</H1> 

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>This paper focuses on the robot and fixture calibration problem from the perspective of simulation and offline programming. The WORKSPACE PC-based robot simulation system and the ROBOTRAK three cable measuring system for calibration are introduced as examples and compared to other commercial systems, and a calibration case study presented.</P>

<H2>The problem</H2>
<P>The repeatability of most industrial robots (the ability to return repeatedly to a given position) is usually  much better than the accuracy (the ability to move to a specified xyz value in space). Typical repeatabilities are about 0.5mm while typical accuracies are of the order of 10mm or worse. This is not a problem when programming a robot using a hand-help teach-pendant and the human eye. Here it is only repeatability that is an issue. However, when programming a robot using some offline system to generate the robot locations numerically the accuracy of the robot becomes all important.</P>
<P>In theory, it is possible to improve the accuracy so that it is as good as the repeatability. The reason that the accuracy of robots is so bad is because there are manufacturing tolerances involved in the production of each robot. The two most significant sources of error are discrepancies in the robot link lengths and in the zero position of each joint.</P>
<P>What is required is a system that will take measurements of the xyz position of the end of the robot, compare them with the robot's own estimate of its position, and thereby find estimates for the errors and model these errors to improve the accuracy of offline programming.</P>

<H2>Measuring systems</H2>
<P>Systems for measuring robot position divide into two basic categories. The first includes all optical systems which use non-contact line-of-sight methods. The second includes all cable driven systems. An example of an optical system is the SPACE theodolite system developed by the Fraunhofer Institute (IPK) in Berlin, where a 3D target location on the end of the robot is determined by optical triangulation. Two or more motor-driven theodolites with power-focus and electronic imaging are used to obtain information on target direction via image processing software. This information drives the theodolites to track the moving target. The target must be visible from all directions, so a 6mm self-illuminated ceramic sphere is used [1]. This system has been developed and tested in collaboration with Volkswagen (VW), KUKA, and Leica.</P>
<P>The same group have also tested a system named SMART which uses a single tracking laser interferometer to locate the 3D position of a reflector by measuring polar coordinates (two angles and one distance). This is the favoured measuring device of the group because of its operational simplicity.
A group at Surrey University have developed a 2 laser system named Optotrac. A reflective target is attached to the end of the robot and used to reflect the 2 beams. If the target is not hit in the centre by the beams then the reflections are offset, and these offsets are used to track the target[2].</P>
<P>A low-cost approach was adopted by a group from Amsterdam University. A CCD camera mounted on the robot-hand is pointed at a flat plate on which a pattern of circles is printed. While not able to achieve the accuracy of other measuring systems, this system might provide a cheap means for partial recalibration after repair [3].</P>
<P>The Compugage two cable system developed by Dynalog has been used extensively in calibration [4]. While more rugged and therefore more appropriate to shop-floor use than optical systems, the set up and measurement procedure is lengthy and cumbersome. Even with extensive training the entire process can take 6 hours or more to calibrate an individual robot. An error at any stage leads to inaccurate results. The Chrysler Motor company, who have used this system, say that each minute of down-time on a production line costs them 20,000 dollars. The time taken for calibration is therefore a critical factor in choosing the right system. The shop-floor environment does not lend itself to complex or lengthy operations. What is required is a system that is accurate yet simple and quick to operate.</P>
<P>Robotrak is a 3-cable mechanical system for measuring the x,y,z position of the endpoint of the robot to within 0.2mm. One person is capable of performing the entire setup in 20 minutes, with the total calibration completed in less than an hour. Compared to other calibration systems Robotrak is simple, rugged, and extremely cost-effective.</P>
<P>Robotrak consists of three cables which extend from drums which are fixed at the corners of a roughly equilateral triangle somewhere within the robot workcell. The distance between the drums is typically 2 metres, but may be varied with the size of the robot to be measured. The cables meet at a fixture which is attached to the robot faceplate or tool. The length of the cables at any moment during the movement of the robot is calculated form the number of rotations of the drums and read into an IBM microcomputer. In this way the x,y,z position of the robot logged may be measured.</P>

<H2>Setting up and using Robotrak</H2>
<P>Robotrak is set up in coordination with the WORKSPACE robot simulation package as follows:<P>
<P>1. Place the three cable drums in a roughly equilateral triangle pattern of side approximately 2m somewhere within the workcell. Note that this can be on the floor, on a fixture, on a wall, on the ceiling, or at any angle to the robot. The position of the drums relative to the robot does not need to be known since this is calculated as part of the calibration process. This flexibility of positioning Robotrak within the workcell is one of the great advantages of this system.</P>
<P>2. Insert the Robotrak interface card into an IBM PC  compatible microcomputer which runs the WORKSPACE robot simulation.</P>
<P>3. The encoders measuring the number of rotations of the drums and thereby indicating the extension of the cable are zeroed (with the cables at zero extension) by pressing a button within WORKSPACE.</P>
<P>4. Each cable is then extended to the end of a metal robot of known length and another button pressed. This enables WORKSPACE to calculate the ratio of encoder counts to length of extension in mm.</P>
<P>5. Cable 1 is extended to a known point on drum 2, cable 2 to drum 3, and cable 3 to drum 1. A button is pressed in WORKSPACE and the encoder counts at the drums are automatically recorded and converted to lengths. The relative position of all the drums is now known.</P>
<P>6. The cables are now extended to meet at the robot endpoint. The cables meet inside a small metal fitting that can be clamped either precisely at the end of the tool (if the tool is to be calibrated at the same time as the robot) or at any unknown point on the end link or tool of the robot. Robotrak can now provide a continuous reading of the xyz position of the end of the robot relative to an arbitrary coordinate frame fixed at one of the drums.</P>
<P>7. The robot is moved to 25 different positions and orientations throughout its working envelope. At each position the robot teach pendant is used to store a teachpoint on the robot controller, and a button is pressed in WORKSPACE to record an xyz measurement of the position end of the robot.</P>
<P>8. The teachpoint file is then copied from the robot controller onto the IBM PC compatible microcomputer and loaded into WORKSPACE. WORKSPACE then compares the teachpoint file with the measurements and  searches for changes in the physical structure of the robot model within the simulation that would enable it to behave in the same way as the real robot.</P>

<P>The WORKSPACE calibration software
WORKSPACE is a PC-based robot simulation software package that makes extensive use of the Robotrak measuring system for calibration. Robotrak is part of the WORKSPACE system, and is used to calibrate robots prior to offline programming. The software for the calibration is an integral part of WORKSPACE and all the calibration options are available from WORKSPACE menus.</P>
<P>The main advantages to the user of a calibration system integrated with the simulation system are that the user interface is greatly simplified and that the price is low compared with discrete calibration and simulation systems. This is the first time that such close integration has been achieved.</P>
<P>Robot simulation, calibration, and offline programming may therefore be seen as a seamless process, in which robot programmes may be transferred to and from each stage with out any problem as is often required during the cell design process.</P>
<P>Errors which may be detected and modelled by WORKSPACE and Robotrak include:</P>
<P>(a) The zero position of each joint (the position of the joint where the value of the joint variable is 0),</P>
<P>(b) The length of each link and the distance offset at each link,</P>
<P>(c) The compliance at each joint (the sag of the arm at the joint due to the weight of the robot links when the robot is in a particular position),</P>
<P>(d) The xyz tool offset from the mounting plate to the end of the tool,</P>
<P>(e) The position and orientation of the measuring system coordinate frame relative to the robot base coordinate frame.</P>
<P>The ability of WORKSPACE to calculate the correct position and orientation of the Robotrak drums relative to the robot as part of the calibration means that Robotrak may be mounted at any unknown position in the workcell.</P>
<P>By taking one additional measurement on the tool axis using Robotrak the orientation of the approach vector of the tool may be calculated.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE extracts these errors from the physical measurements and teachpoints by trying to find a robot model that would best fit the measured characteristics. The WORKSPACE kinematic model of the robot is then modified accordingly. Any points generated within WORKSPACE during the course of a simulation are then passed through a filter which alters the points in such a way that the uncalibrated real robot will be fooled in to moving to the point we really wanted it to move to by asking it to move to another, slightly different point. It is necessary to work this way since the real robot can have no knowledge of its physical inadequacies. Another filter may then be used when taking teachpoints back from the uncalibrated robot into calibrated model.</P>
<P>With Robotrak measuring points to an absolute accuracy of 0.2mm it is possible to obtain results from the calibration such that the accuracy of an industrial robot such as the ABB IRB6000 during offline programming is improved from 10 to 20 mm to better than 1mm.</P>
<P>Note that ROBOTRACK may also be used for measuring the position of the robot while it is moving along a path, for the purpose of checking the accuracy of paths generated on the robot controller. These paths may then be automatically displayed in 3D using WORKSPACE and compared with that generated during a simulation.</P>

<P>Calibrating the workcell fixtures
Once the robot has been calibrated and its offline programmed accuracy improved to a suitable level then the robot may itself be used as a measuring device to find the true position of the fixtures in the workcell relative to the robot. This is an important issue since without knowing these positions accurately the offline generated robot programmes would be unusable. Another method measuring the position of fixtures is by using Robotrak itself (any measurements taken after calibration are adjusted  by WORKSPACE so that they are expressed relative to the robot base). A third method is to use theodolites to measure the position of the robot base and all important points on the fixture. However, this method involves a great deal of time and expense.</P>
<P>Once the position of the fixtures relative to the robot is known then the position of the models of the fixtures in the simulation package can be adjusted, enabling the simulation to accurate robot paths relative to the fixtures and the parts held in the fixtures.</P>

<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<P>If the accuracy required by a robot application of the order of 1mm and the robot programme is to be generated by an offline software package such as a graphical robot simulation then it is necessary to calibrate the robot first. Robots have no in-built knowledge of their own manufacturing tolerances and therefore the calibration results must be used at the offline stage to fool the robot into moving to a desired position by asking it to move to a slightly different position. Though many calibration systems exist, their worth should be measured by how effectively they coordinate with robot simulation software to improve the accuracy of robot programmes generated offline.</P>
<P>In the future we can expect more and more companies to follow the lead of Reis Robots in providing partial calibration of the robot before supplying the robot to the customer, though the customer will still need to calibrate the robot tool, calibrate for zero position drift, and calibrate after the replacement of robot components. The next generation of robot controllers will be designed to be robot simulation friendly in their ability to take account of errors detected by calibration.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1">1. Introduction</a></H2>

<P>Simulation is a tool that is readily accepted within education and industry as a means to see, by computer design, the futures requirements. Every University sets a project to produce a simulation system, there are many systems on the market today each with benefits suitable for individual requirements, but few that can be called truly commercial.</P>

<P>Robot Simulations Ltd., have developed the first PC based robotics simulation system that can compete with main frame and graphics work station systems at a fraction of the cost. The aim is to bring the applications of robotics to the student, the trainee, the designer and, in fact, any type of user.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2">2. The need for simulation.</a></H2>

<P>The designing of efficient work cells is a difficult task. The need to predict robot movement, to avoid interference between robots and determine the optimum placement for maximum reach is essential for the workcell design engineer. The ability to design within confined spaces where there is a high risk of collision together with identification of possible production bottlenecks is of the utmost importance and then,  to know how long each process within a cycle will take.</P>

<P>The changing of an existing workcell means down-time. Studies indicate that it can take more than 60 working hours to redesign a single robot manufacturing cell. Time is money and the cost of robot ownership must be kept to a minimum as the diagram (fig. 1) shows.</P>

fig.1

<P>When a new design is to be incorporated, the concepts must be clearly communicated to all team members. A 3D system is preferred, as a 2D system can be misinterpreted. Simulation allows the planning of safety factors because operating robots can carry a risk of injury. Safety equipment can be placed in accordance with regulations and the training of robot operators can be supervised without risk to either trainer or trainee.</P>

<P>The benefits of  using simulation can easily be measured. With a faster design of new work cell layouts, the engineering effort is reduced creating less pressure on the team. Faster redesign means reduced down-time in line shutdowns for on-line programming. New ideas can be tested on the computer, eliminating costly mistakes. Cycle times can be reset to produce optimum schedules by verifying robot reach and collision detection. More importantly optimisation of the workcell can be achieved off-line, allowing the robot to continue operating during the planning phase. Off-line programming is available for similar reasons, and can be downloaded to the robot controller.</P>

<P>The potential applications of simulation are varied. In the automotive industry there is Arc and Spot welding, Paint spraying, adhesives, sealants and more. In the machine tool industry there is CNC machine loading and unloading, deburring and others. Recently new applications such as remote telemanipulation, nuclear decommissioning, deep sea robotics and space research are all using simulation as the tool to bring the projects to maturity.</P>

<P>What tools are needed to enable the user to get the best out of a simulation package? Firstly we must look at the needs of the user. The obvious first requirement is powerful user friendly software. To run the system, powerful computer hardware, recent advances in computer technology have made such systems available on a PC's either on Desk-top or Lap-top. Within the software there must be a comprehensive CAD system and a data exchange format. Accurate models of real industrial robots must be easily accessed together with mechanical modelling tools. the simulation language must be sophisticated in order to service the full requirements of the program and the user.</P>

<P>As we are specifically dealing in robot simulation, there must be robot placement tools to test robot reach, check tool orientation and highlight any changes of configuration. A robot does not work alone, other devices such as conveyors, part feeders, CNC machines, ROV's can be simulated. A calibration facility to ensure that each model matches the real world workcell is imperative. Again collision detection must be a feature included in the software.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3">3. Introducing WORKSPACE(tm)</a></H2>

<P>Having listed the requirements of a professional industrial simulation system, WORKSPACE 3 can be introduced. WS3.2 is the world's most advanced PC based robot simulation system, using a standard PC compatible microcomputer. Let us look at the benefits of a PC based system and the features that are available. Firstly the features: High quality 3D graphics in Super VGA gives workstation quality on-screen shaded imaging. An off-line programming capability operated by a mouse driven draw-down menu method gives the system user flexibility. A library of standard industrial robots such as ABB, KUKA, Fanuc, Nachi, Kawasaki, Adept, Unimation and others gives the user more options to choose from, incorporating  the visual design and simulation with a consistent user-friendly interface.</P>

<H2><A NAME="4">4. WORKSPACE Features.</a></H2>

<P>The sophisticated industrial standard 3D CAD system contains a library of standard primitives, Constructive Solid Geometry, B�zier surfaces, easy to use CAD editor, dimensioning and an industrial standard DXF and IGES interface. All models can be in wireframe, hidden-line or shaded.</P>

<P>With a kinematics and inverse kinematics modeller for serial and parallel joint mechanisms, visual editing of the robot dimensions is possible and parameters such as joint limits, velocities and accelerations are easily set by the user.</P>

<P>The simulation language also incorporates an advanced robot language to enable such programming routines as variables, sub-routines, loop structures, logic structures and sophisticated logic commands. Programmes are created visually by using the menu interface. This allows any number and brand of robots, mechanisms, conveyors, parts feeders and AGV's to be programmed and run concurrently. There are other robot language options available.</P>

<P>Within the programming facility there is a text editor which acts as an integral editor for program files. A "trace" function is installed to assist in the creation of error free robot programmes. Another interactive text and simulation system is the CAL (Computer Aided Learning) system. This allows training exercises to be mixed with text giving multi-option questions and answers. Simulation is an ideal teaching tool, students can work on accurate industrial models in complete safety, the need for full time supervision is reduced allowing quality teaching. Finally simulation eliminates the need for expensive robotics hardware until the students and trainees are more capable and knowledgeable of the subject.</P>

<P>The open architecture of WORKSPACE allows the import of external simulation routines and it will allow the user to modify or add inverse kinematics solutions. WS3.2 also contains a complete robot and workcell calibration system which is necessary for off-line programming.</P>

<P>General mechanisms can be simulated, with either serial or branch models and with translational and rotational joints, as can parallelograms. The mechanisms can be controlled independently or as an auxiliary axis. This feature allows complex grippers to be modelled. To determine the movement of slave joints arithmetic expressions are used.</P>

<P>Dynamics are shown to analyse demand, torque, forces, actual trajectory and joint error. The user can go into the section of relevant source code and modify the algorithms to suit other dynamics requirements using the "Userdyn" command. The controller parameters are adjustable and all results can be graphically displayed.</P>

<P>The open architecture of WORKSPACE has many advantages, the Dynamic Linked Library allows the integration of user defined Pascal, C and C++ routines. "Usercall" permits special functions to be added to a track language by the user. "Autoexec" is a feature that can control WORKSPACE by an external script generated by another program.</P>

<P>The number of robot languages within workspace is increasing all the time. Currently installed are Karel(tm) 2 & 3.06, ABB ARLA(tm), VAL(tm), VAL II(tm), V/V+(tm) and AS. Others to be implemented are RAL 10-II(tm), DARL(tm), ROBOSTAR(tm), AML3(tm) and others. </P>

<P>One of the unique features of the WORKSPACE integrated system is the off-line programming facility. The programmes are written in the native controller language that can either be downloaded by floppy disk or RS interface and are compatible with other programming protocols. Calibration of robots within WS3 gives the differences between the ideal robot and real-world robot affected by manufacturing tolerances. This can be extended to the calibration of the workcell, giving accurate placement of objects and devices. The physical link between the robot and the controller can be adapted. Floppy disk transfer is possible but most controllers support serial connection with either an RS 232 interface or RS 422. It may be necessary to have a patchbox for correct wiring. The distance from the computer to the controller can be overcome by simply installing WS3.2 on to a portable PC, thus taking the simulation to the factory floor. (see fig.2). WORKSPACE can also read from the controller back to the PC.</P>

<IMG SRC="jirfig2.gif"></IMG>

<P>WORKSPACE 3 has only recently been released but already it is solving real problems in both industry and education.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5">5. Case studies.</a></H2>

<H3>Case Study 1. Cimtas, Turkey.</H3>

<P>Cimtas are a forward looking company in the manufacture of large steel structures for the construction industry. </P>

<P>The application was the arc welding of large steel "I" beams. They needed a 10 axes movement of the workcell simulated as it was difficult to visualise all the movements. It was not possible to confirm the choice of robot before purchase and it was impossible to test ideas on the factory floor. Because of the orientation problems there was a high chance of collisions at the extremes of the robot envelope. (See fig.3)</P>


<IMG SRC="jirfig3.gif"></IMG>						fig.3



<P>First a model workcell was built in WORKSPACE, as in fig. 3, this contained 1 overhead robot fixed to a rotating table, in turn bolted to an extended overhead gantry, a track mounted rotating table at 90� from horizontal plane. The two chosen robots were tested in the simulation environment. The movement of the auxiliary axes was optimised to give maximum working envelope and minimise the risk of collisions. Then the exact height was obtained for the robot above floor level to avoid exceeding joint limits during welds. WORKSPACE helped the system become operational within a few weeks and eliminated the ongoing problems. A choice of robot was made, the optimum height was fixed, potential collisions eradicated and considerable time and money saved.</P>

<H3>Case Study 2. University of Plymouth, UK.</H3>

<P>Plymouth needed a software system which enabled students as much time as possible dealing in "real world" robotics. The problems encountered were: (i) The cost of robots to meet the demands of the robotics group. (ii) The cost of existing software running on workstations.  (iii) The number within the group had to be reduced in order to provide effective supervision and teaching.</P>

<P>The solution was for Robot Simulations Ltd., in discussions with the University, to provide various features that could be used specifically for teaching. Several features in WS3 were already being implemented for industrial applications such as , Userdyn, Dynamic Linked Libraries, Usercall and Autoexec which could be adapted for education. Each of these features allows the lecturer to set individual course work for an increased number of students.</P>

<P>The result of this development was a B.Sc (Hons) course in Robotics and Automation which started in September 1993, with WS3 as the core software for the full 4 year course. The savings in both robotics and computer hardware/software gave greater flexibility to the budget allowing more students to enroll ( +60%), more 1 to 1 teaching, upgrading of existing equipment and purchase of new robots from basic educational units through various standards to main brand industrial types to enable industrial level project work.</P>

<H1>World Acclaim for Newcastle Firm's PC Based Robot Simulation system</H1> 

<P>Recognised authorities from international academic and manufacturing circles have acknowledged the advances in robotics simulation made by a pioneering Newcastle business</P>

<P>4 year old Robot Simulations, now Robot Simulations Ltd., of Lynnwood Business Centre in Newcastle has developed the "WORKSPACE" range of PC based robotics 3D simulation, calibration and off-line programming software claimed as the first to compete with mainframe or graphics workstation based systems at a fraction of the cost. The opportunities, says Managing Director Roger Verrall, are almost limitless. With 20,000 educational potential users around the world and some 500,000 industrial robots, the world is our oyster.</P>

<P>Developed by ex-Newcastle University Dr. John Owens ( now Technical Director ), WORKSPACE has already been bought by many UK and European companies and colleges and also USA, Taiwan, Korea, Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Brasil and has attracted enthusiastic response from the Japanese and USA Robotics Associations. A distributor covering the whole of North America has recently been appointed with an identified user base of 20,000 industrial sites.</P>

<P>Closer to home RSL are working with Pilkington Glass and Estil ( one of the leading UK automotive system integrators ). Plymouth University was the first in the UK to use WORKSPACE as the core software for its new BSc. (Hons) course in Robotics and Factory Automation with Liverpool John Moore, Leeds Metropolitan and Middlesex Universities are among many that are using it as a major learning tool. Paul Robinson, senior lecturer at Plymouth University's School of Electronics, Communications and Engineering joined Robot Simulations to develop a user friendly learning manual for WORKSPACE, the placement, the first of it's kind, being made through the DTI Senior Academics in Industry Scheme (SAIS) managed by the much vaunted Cranfield Institute of Technology who are also co-operating with RSL on important research projects.</P>

<P>Locally, Komatsu have been working with RSL to help design a new workcell within their Birtley Plant. This contact is seen as very important as Komatsu, being a major international company could use WS on a world-wide basis.</P>

<P>Major US car maker invites RSL to demonstrate WS at their new production facility near Detroit. US Waterjet cutting company have bought WS for their new process. Major Swedish furniture manufacture bought after a student now employed at the company recommended WS. Roger Verrall sees potential in almost every area of industry and the growing service robotics market.</P>

<H1>Workspace - a Microcomputer-based Industrial Robot Simulator and Offline Programming System</H1> 
</HEAD>

<H2>Published in 1994</H2>

<H2>Introduction.</H2>
<P>WORKSPACE has been developed by a team led by the Author as the world's first industrial robot simulation software package. Since its commercial release in 1989 it has undergone many revisions. With the latest software release (version 3.2) WORKSPACE is in use on over 500 industrial and educational sites world-wide as both a graphic simulation system and a means of off-line programming a robot workcell.</P>

<P>Creating and simulating robot programmes. WORKSPACE is a software package which will create and simulate robot programmes in the native language of the robot. For example, users of Fanuc robots may write robot programmes in Karel, ABB robot users may write robot programmes in ARLA. </P>
<P>There is therefore no need for postprocessors to translate from a simulation language to the robot language: the full power of the robot language is available to the user through off-line programming. It is also possible to transfer existing robot programmes from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE for optimisation. Off-line programming is therefore a two-way process using WORKSPACE. is This particularly facilitated by the use of portable microcomputers which may be taken down onto the factory floor and used next to a robot workcell.</P>
<P>The user first selects the target robot language required. To create a robot programme the user clicks the mouse on robot commands on a pull-down menu. These commands are immediately written to an ASCII text file. In this way a robot programme is created without the necessity for typing the command words, though the user may also use an in-built text editor if desired. As each command is written to the file it is simulated graphically on the computer screen in colour 3d solid graphics.</P>
<P>Programmes may be debugged by tracing through line by line seeing at each line what is happening in the simulation. The value of variables may be watched or examined throughout. If an error occurs at any point then the user will immediately be placed in the WORKSPACE text editor at the position in the robot programme where the error occurred, enabling the error to be promptly corrected.</P>

Figure 1 - Off-line programming is a two-way process using WORKSPACE

<P>The full structure of the robot languages is implemented, including typed variables, teachpoints, subroutines, looping, branching on condition, signals, and condition handler interrupts.</P>

<P>Several robots working in co-ordination, each under the control of a separate robot programme, may be simulated to produce one animation.
During the simulation of the robot programme any collisions that occur between any objects in the workcell may be automatically reported, and a clock indicates the time taken for the overall sequence of movements. The 3D volume of the envelope may be plotted, or 2D slices through the envelope displayed on the screen.</P>

<P>All the main industrial and educational robot languages are implemented, and a library of over 140 robot models is available to the user (though it is also possible for users to create their own robots).</P>

<P>The 3D CAD system and kinematics modeller. 3D solid objects (including combinations created using Constructive Solid Geometry) or surfaces (including Bspline, Parametric, or Bezier surfaces) may be created using WORKSPACE's own 3D CAD system, or else imported into WORKSPACE form an external CAD system using the DXF file format (common amongst microcomputer based CAD systems such as AUTOCAD) or the IGES file format (common amongst graphics workstation based CAD systems such as CATIA). The use of an unlimited number of layers for storing different levels of detail makes it possible to turn off the display of object irrelevant to the current task, or display them in wireframe for speed.</P>

<P>The movement of any mechanism may be modelled using a kinematics modeller. The mechanism may have any number of joints in any serial or tree-structure combination. Conveyors, automatic vehicles, and other independently moving objects may also be modelled.</P>

<H2>Defining positions</H2>
<P>Positions and paths for the robot tool to move to may be defined in several ways. A software emulation of a teach pendant is available to move the robot either by stepping individual joint angles or by stepping the xyz Cartesian position of the tool relative to the robot world co-ordinate frame. Positions may be saved as teachpoints for use later in a robot programme. These are displayed on the screen graphically as co-ordinate frames. If the robot is placed in a different position in the workcell then the teachpoints will change colour if they are no longer achievable due to the limits on the joints of the robot or due to the limited reach of the robot.</P>
<P>Positions may also be defined by clicking the mouse at different positions on the computer screen (changing the view if necessary to define a 3D position). Orientations may be defined in many different ways: for example by dragging the approach vector of the teachpoint co-ordinate frame in a particular direction using the mouse.</P>

<H2>Geometry Points</H2>
<P>The easiest and most powerful way of defining robot positions is to use the geometry of objects. </P>
<P>Points may be defined along the seam between two surfaces in such a way that the position of the point on the seam, the distance of the point from the seam, the lean of the approach vector of the tool towards the seam, or the angle between the adjacent surfaces and the tool approach vector is set by the user. This is of use in applications such as arc-welding.</P>

Figure 2 - Defining Geometry points normal to a surface

<P>Points may also be defined normal to a surface so that the position on the surface and the distance form the surface to the point is set by the user. As the point is moved over the surface the point is always maintained normal to the surface. This is of use in applications such as spot-welding.</P>
<P>Paths to follow a 2D curve may be defined automatically. Straight line and segments of the curve are translated directly into linear and circular motions for the robot tool to follow. This is of use in applications such as water-jet cutting.</P>

<H2>Calibration</H2>
<P>Calibration is an important issue in off-line programming and simulation because the resulting robot programme is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. WORKSPACE supports three types of calibration.</P>
<P>Calibration of the robot tool involves finding the xyz offset that must be added onto the kinematics of the robot to account for the tool attached to the end of the robot. This uses a procedure in which the robot and tool is moved repeatedly to a fixed location and the resulting teachpoints taken from the robot controller back into WORKSPACE. A multivariable search technique is then used to calculate the tool offset. This procedure may need to be repeated if the tool is knocked out of alignment during use.</P>
<P>A similar technique may be used to find the true zero position of the robot. This is necessary since the zero position every joint of the robot is subject to drift during use. The resulting offsets are used to produce a more accurate robot model than the kinematics used on the robot controller itself.</P>
<P>Finally, the true position of objects in the workcell may be measured using the robot as a measuring device, and the resulting teachpoints taken back into WORKSPACE and either used to define planes whose intersection redefines vertices or else used to redefine known positions within the model.</P>
<P>In the future it is hoped that WORKSPACE will be integrated with a mechanical calibration system for measuring 3D positions within the workcell independently of the robot.</P>

<H2>Replaying simulations in real-time</H2>
<P>Simulations may be replayed within WORKSPACE in real-time, but recent advances in animation technology enable even more realistic playback. WORKSPACE simulations may be translated into the FLC file format used by AUTODESK Animator and replayed using a utility at speeds up to 50 frames a second. The resulting full screen animations are so realistic, even on a medium range 486 colour notebook, that it is like looking through a window onto the factory floor. The utility for replaying FLC files will be bundled with the WORKSPACE software.</P>

<H2>Simulation of Dynamics</H2>
<P>It is possible to simulate the dynamics of a robot using WORKSPACE for a defined sequence of movements. The equations relating the torques and accelerations at each joint and their interactions for a 6-axis robot are modelled using numerical integration. Two type of controller equation may be used: classical and discrete-time control. The constant multipliers in the controller equations may be modified and the resulting effect on the trajectory examined. The effect of attaching a payload to the end of the robot may also be examined. However, until it is possible to obtain accurate estimates for the mass, inertia matrices, centre of gravity, and controller constants at each joint, dynamics simulation is only of use in demonstrating general principles and obtaining qualitative not quantitative information.</P>

<H2>The Future</H2>
<P>For many years robot companies have not been co-operative in providing the information required to accurately simulate the paths generated by the robot controller when moving through via points. Without this information it is difficult for a simulation to provide precise cycle-times. Now, the large Automotive robot users, many of whom have committed themselves irrevocably to off-line programming, are beginning to make it a condition of future robot orders that this information is provided as a black box to the simulation companies.</P>
<P>However, simulation and off-line programming will only become widely accepted if there is a change in attitude within the simulation companies, who at present seem unwilling to get involved on the factory floor. Simulation is often carried out on the other side of the factory, or in some cases on the other side of the country. The resulting programmes are then taken down onto the factory floor  This is where the problems for the people on the factory floor begin. Reality is seldom the same as a simulation, and the robot programmes usually require modification, but by this time the simulation is being used on the next project.</P>
<P>This gap between the factory floor and the simulation is one that WORKSPACE is designed to close, by enabling a portable microcomputer to be taken down onto the factory flood and the simulation to be used next to the robot controller, and by allowing robot programmes to be shuffled backwards and forwards between the simulation and the robot controller as many times as required.</P>

<H2><A name="1">1. Introduction</a></H2>

<P>Due to the ever increasing demands placed upon the industrial robot in terms of application requirements involving precise path following, both robot manufacturers and industrial end users require to know the dynamic behaviour of the robotics system. In particular it is becoming critically important to know the precise trajectory taken by the robot tool point ( Ref.1 ). Hence there is a need for a measuring system capable of tracking a selected tool point. The system should be portable have good world accuracy capability, be flexible in its use in terms of velocity range, acceleration range and data capture period, and above all, be affordable.</P>

<P>This paper presents such a measuring system which has been the subject of three years intense research conducted by the author and his associates both academic and industrial.</P>

<IMG SRC="robofig1.gif"></IMG>
fig. 1
<H2><a name="2">2.0 System Concept and Overview.</a></H2>

<P>The robot tracking system, ROBOTRAK, utilises three wires, the lengths of which are continually measured over a fast time base using three measuring units placed at known locations in space. A calibration triangle is used to set the location of the measuring units and to set the origin of ROBOTRAK relative to the world co-ordinate system of the robot under test. Knowing the accurate positions of the measuring units relative to each other and the instantaneous position of the robot point can be calculated ( Ref. 2. ) in a Cartesian co-ordinate system based in the measuring unit positions, ( Fig. 1 ). The system equations derived by considering the geometry of the three wires and measuring unit are:-</P>
<P>Px = Bx�  +  Ra�  -  Rb�</P>
2Bx

<P>Py = Cy�  +  Ra�  -  Rc�</P>
2Cy
<P>Pz� = Ra�  -  Px�  -  Py�</P>

<P>where : Px, Py and Pz are the instantaneous co-ordinates of the tool point relative to the origin; measuring unit (1). All variables are shown in Fig. 1.</P>

<P>Digital signals from the three measuring units are fed to an electronic interface unit which is connected to a PC for data reduction and analysis. The results are presented graphically with hard copies available from a four colour pen plotter. Time histories of position, velocity and acceleration are produced and path plots of any two position axes from the three available generated. ROBOTRAK may be considered to consist of three basic sub-systems ; the measuring units, the electronic interface unit and the computer hardware/software system. ( Ref. 3 ).</P>

<H2><A name="3">3.0 Measuring Units.</a></H2>

<P>The three measuring units consist of a storage drum, a pulley fitted with an incremental encoder and a wire guide. All three parts are mounted on a single plate.</P>

<P>The storage drum is used as a take up spool for the tensator spring, it is supported on a needle roller bearing and is free to slide on the shaft.</P>

<P>The main pulley and encoder unit is assembled on a single turned component which bolts onto the mounting plate. A shaft bolts directly onto the encoder shaft and is supported by the bearing in the encoder and a ball bearing at the pulley end of the shaft. The tensator spring is bolted onto the pulley to supply the drive. Wire is wrapped around the pulley and fed out through the wire guide. It is terminated using a swivel jointed clip.</P>

<P>Fig 2. Shows an assembly design drawing of the measuring units used.</P>

<H2><A name="4">4.0 Electronic Interface Unit.</a></H2>

<P>The interface unit is a three channel device complete with its own power supply. Three decoding circuits are used to process data from the encoders and input 16 bit values, on request, to a PC through a 1MHz communications bus. The decoding circuit cards are slot mounted in a standard 19 inch rack which also houses the power supply.</P>

<P>These circuits consist of essentially 4 I.C's.</P>

<P>b)	LS 373 Octal D type latches.</P>
<P>c)	LS 138 Decoders/multiplexor.</P>
<P>d)	LS 14 Hex Schmitt-trigger inverters</P>

<P>The outputs to the circuits are connected to the 1 MHz bus.</P>

<P>Operation is relatively simple.</P>

<P>The LS 2000 keeps track of the encoder value. On receiving the correct signal on the 1 MHz bus (fed through the LS 138 multiplexor ) the value is latched by the LS 373 and can be read by the PC.</P>

<P>The circuit is an 8 bit circuit so that two " reads " are needed to get a complete 16 bit encoder value.</P>

<P>The latching of all circuits is performed when encoder 1 is read. This ensures that all three values are taken at the same time. The values can then be read into the PC.</P>

<P>Reading the following addresses; in the PC performs the following :-</P>

<P>Address	&FCOO	Latches all lsb and reads lsb enc. 1.</P>
<P>		&FCO1	Reads lsb enc. 2.</P>
<P>		&FCO2	Reads lsb enc. 3.</P>
<P>		&FCO4	Latches all msb and reads msb enc. 1.</P>
<P>		&FCO5	Reads msb enc. 2.</P>
<P>		&FCO6	Reads msb enc. 3.</P>

<H2><A name="5">5.0 Computer Hardware/Software.</A></H2>

<P>The function of this sub-system is to receive 16 bit numbers from the 3 channel electronic interface unit. To pre-process, store and data reduce this information and produce graphical output in a usable format.</P>

<H2>5.1 Computer Hardware.</H2>

<P>An IBM PC compatible 386 with 40MB hard disk and 2 MB of RAM</P>

<H2>5.2 System Software.</H2>

<P>The system software consists of a suite of programmes in Windows(tm) used to run and calibrate ROBOTRAK. The software is menu driven and functions are selected by either a mouse or user defined function keys. Fig. 4. shows the menu selection flowchart. On start up, the system automatically selects the Introduction menu.</P>

<H3>Introduction Menu</H3>
	
<P>Three options are presented :-</P>

<P>1.	Set up Parameters. - This option is used to define the test routine to be used and under what filename the data is to be stored. On selection a Parameter Menu is entered.</P>

<P>2.	Perform Test. - This option is used to actually record the data. The test routine being defined as previously defined in the Parameter menu. The user is given the option to Rezero the encoders prior to the test routine being performed. If it is suspected that the counters have been reset while the wires have been connected to the robot at any stage, this option must be followed. ( Pressing the Break key resets the 1 MHz bus and hence the counters to zero ). The test routine is then performed and a Testing Menu offered on completion of the test.</P>

<P>3.	Analyse the Results. - This option is for processing the stored data and selecting the output required.</P>

<H3>Parameter Menu	( Set up Parameters ).</H3>

<P>This menu allows the operator to set the following test parameters.</P>

<P>1.	Filename. - The filename for storing results. A maximum of 5 characters will be accepted.<P>

<P>2.	Sample Rate. - The data sampling rate can be set within the range of 200 to 1000 	readings per second.</P>


<P>3.	Test Length. - Up to a maximum of 4000 points can be recorded. The maximum 	allowable time in seconds for the chosen sampling rate is displayed.</P>

<P>4.	Start Mode. - Three start modes are available :</P> 
		
<P>M - manual mode starts on pressing the spacebar of the computer.</P>

<P>A - Automatic mode starts when motion of the robot is sensed.</P>

<P>E - External mode utilises an external trigger connected to the User Port of the Microcomputer to trigger the recording.</P>

<P>5.	Comments. - A string of up to 30 characters can be added to define the test. These 	can be printed by the plotter if required.</P>

<P>Once all the parameters have been set the user can change them simply by pressing the appropriate function key and re-entering the data.</P>

<P>When the parameters are correct F6 returns the user to the Introductions Menu.</P>

<H3>Testing Menu( Perform Test )</H3>

<P>This is entered by selecting the second option of the Introduction Menu. The user is first given the option to reset the counters and then the test is performed.</P>

<P>On completion of the test, three options are available :-</P>

<P>1.	Redo - Allows the operator to re-run the test.</P>

<P>2.	Save - Validates the date, calculates the Cartesian co-ordinates of the end effector of the robot and stores the results in the file name specified by the parameter Menu. This procedure takes approximately 60 seconds/250 points.</P>

<P>3.	Quit. - Returns the user to the introduction menu without saving the data.</P>

<H3>Plot Menu Selection</H3>

<P>This menu is entered on selecting the third option of the introduction menu if no previous screen are available for analysis. It is used to define the starting screen for the analysis.</P>

<P>The first menu offers two options :-</P>

<P>1.	Time - Plots against time</P>
<P>2.	Plane - Plots views of the Cartesian planes.</P>
<P>On selecting the Time option the following options are available :-</P>
<P>1.	X-T	X position against time</P>
<P>2.	Y-T	Y position against time</P>
<P>3.	Z-T	Z position against time</P>
<P>4.	V-T	Velocity against time</P>
<P>5.	A-T	Acceleration against time</P>
<P>On selecting the Plane option the following views are offered:-</P>

<P>1.	X-Y</P>
<P>2.	Y-Z</P>
<P>3.	Z-X</P>

<P>On completion of the selection the axes are plotted and the user is returned to the Control Menu.</P>

<H3>Control Menu( Analyse the Results )</H3>

<P>This is the main menu for the analysis of the data. It allows the operator to define files to plot graphs, to draw and scaling of axes.</P>

<P>Five options are available :-</P>

<P>1.	Windo - Allows one to change the graph shown, either to a different scale or to different axes.</P>

<P>2.	Hcopy - Gives a hard copy of the results. Copy Menu is presented.</P>

<P>3.	Nwfil - Defines filenames to be plotted. Inputting * and tapping "Shift" will scroll through the filenames currently available on disk.</P>

<P>4.	Erase - Deletes one of the currently selected files.</P>

<P>5. 	Quit - Returns to the Introduction Menu.</P>

<H3>Window Menu</H3>

<P>1.	Draw - A box can be drawn around any part of the plot to be enlarged.</P>

<P>2.	Specify - The axes range can be specified numerically.</P>

<P>3.	Reset - Resets the axes scales to the default sizes.</P>

<P>4. 	Plane - Selects a new graph to be plotted. See Plot Selection Menus.</P>

<P>5.	Quit - Returns to the Control Menu and replots the data without changing the data. This can be used in the event of a system failure to return to the previously plotted screen.</P>

<H3>Copy Menu</H3>

<P>1.	Print - Dumps the current screen to a printer.</P>

<P>2.	Plot - Selects output for a colour plotter. Two further options are given in this mode:</P>

<P>1.	New - Sets the plotter for a paper change.</P>

<P>2.	Old - Plots over the old graph.</P>

<P>On selecting New any sheet in the plotter will be ejected and the user prompted to insert a new sheet.</P>

<H2><A name="6">6.0 Measured Performance Specification</a></H2>

<P>In order to validate the output results from ROBOTRAK, performance trials were conducted. Particular trajectories of known velocity and acceleration were set up under laboratory conditions and the ROBOTRAK system used to measure these. The output from ROBOTRAK was then compared against these known values. From these trials ROBOTRAK was found to conform to the following performance specifications.</P>

<P>Static repeatability</P>
<P>Better than �0.2mm within 2m x 2m x 1.2m</P>
<P>Variable path �0.32mm within 2m x 2m x 0.7m</P>
<P>Dynamic repeatability</P>
<P>Same path same speed �0.5mm with 2m�</P>
<P>Same path variable velocity  �0.7mm within 2m�</P>
<P>Maximum allowable velocity = 4m/s</P>
<P>Maximum allowable acceleration = 10m/s�</P>

<H2><A name="7">7.0 Robot Test Examples.</a></H2>

<P>Representative test data obtained during trials on a Unimation Puma 560 are shown in Figs 5 - 11. A simple rectangle path was programmed by teaching the Puma Robot four points. The plane of the rectangle was set perpendicular to the x - y plane of ROBOTRAK, and at 45 degrees to the x axis. The Puma program was set for continuous motion, with no delay or settling times set at the taught points, with the exception of the start / stop point. This was chosen to show the effect of tracking around smooth corner radii. Plots of x against z, y against z and x against y are shown in Figs 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Time histories of x against T and y against T were also plotted and can be seen in Figs 8 and 9 respectively.</P>

<P>Both velocity and acceleration profile plots were produced and are shown in Figs 10 and 11. These two plots show clearly the effect of tracking the corner radii, with the larger peak representing the start / stop point.</P>

<H2><A name="8">8.0 Conclusions</a></H2>

<P>The ROBOTRAK, robot dynamic tracking system presented here has been extensively used for the assessing the performance characteristics of industrial robots both within the GRAG laboratory at Cranfield and "on-site" at various industrial establishments.</P>

<H1>Robotics the need for Simulation - Seeing the whole picture</H1> 
</HEAD>
<H2>Seminar: China Productivity Centre, Taiwan</H2>

<P>Whatever the application in robotics it is essential to ensure that the investment, training and operation in any factory automation project is both thoroughly researched and accurately implemented.</P>

<P>With the introduction of WORKSPACE 3.0, these pre-requisites can be achieved with considerable savings to the small and medium sized customer, without sacrificing quality, but achieving economy of scale.</P>

<P>We will show how the use of simulation can aid each step of the process from the development of an idea to the programming of the final choice of robot. In each instance an example from a case study will be shown from a number of applications and questions may be asked.</P>

<H2>The need for Simulation</H2>

<P>The techniques of computer aided design (CAD) have found extensive use in improving or replacing the process of engineering drawing, architectural drawing and many other applications. However, an engineering process involving many more moving parts can only be fully understood through the process of simulation.</P>

<P>Early developments in this field have involved the computer controlled machining centres using existing CAD systems. Additional software is used to take the original CAD engineering drawing of a machined part and analyse a path across its surface. An animated simulation of the movements a machining centre must go through to create the part from a "raw" block is then displayed. As well as providing a visualisation of the process, a file can be created containing the required instructions to the machining centre. The file can then be executed to create the part.</P>

<P>This extension of computer aided design to computer aided manufacture is highly applicable to industrial robotics. Simulation provides an efficient interactive graphical environment in which to improve the way industrial robots are programmed. Ever-increasing numbers of robot installations are now being planned using computer simulation. Only a few years ago the cost of technology to achieve these aims was prohibitive for all but the largest organisations. However, as with CAD before it, simulation, calibration and programming of industrial robots is possible even on a standard low-cost PC compatible computer. A software package called WORKSPACE, conceived, designed and developed by the UK company Robot Simulations Ltd., can be used to create a robot installation at a fraction of the cost of existing systems.</P>

<P>This talk uses WORKSPACE as an example to show how simulation , calibration and programming can assist the implementation of an automation project.</P>

<H2>Using a Robot Simulation</H2>

<P>WORKSPACE was primarily intended as a visualisation aid for those engineers and managers involved in the process of designing and debugging new or existing robot installations. Benefits such as the ability to detect off-line collisions between robots and objects, and ability to evaluate and optimise the time taken for a sequence of movements off-line have proved major incentives for the investment in robot simulation.</P>

<P>The core of WORKSPACE and the more expensive systems is the 3D CAD modeller. A workcell or even a full manufacturing facility containing a number of work cells can be effectively drawn on the screen, or object geometry's may be imported from a commercial CAD package ( AutoCad ) via a standard graphics Data Exchange File ( DXF ).</P>

<P>The next step is to install a robot or robots into the model. A library of over 100 industrial and educational robots is available for WORKSPACE, thus allowing an engineer to experiment with different configurations in the prototype workcell by simply loading a robot from a disk. A standard robot may be selected from the library and placed in position. The user may also design their own, new robot modelling the "flesh" with the CAD system and defining the mechanical linkages. WORKSPACE then creates the kinematics model for the new robot. Operating parameters such as actual scale size, velocities, accelerations and joint limits are all simulated.</P>

<P>A robot program can then be created, simulated and downloaded. Robot programmes are created by selecting the required operating language from the pull down menu system and interaction with the model using the mouse pointer. The graphical interface is considerably more intuitive than most numerically based robot operating systems. For example, it is possible to define a robot position relative to the model by pointing at a position with the mouse. The robot tool might then be automatically reorientated so that it is normal to the plain of the object face - a feature which is particularly useful in surface type applications.</P>

<P>Commands are also available to carry out more complex tasks at the click of the mouse cursor. Some examples include paint spraying or applying glue evenly over a given surface , welding along seams or grasping an object. By using these commands it is possible to write a program very quickly.</P>

<P>These progammes are then used firstly to move a robot in the model to produce a realistic animation, in shading of the 3D objects due to an arbitrary light source. Features such as conveyors, robots mounted on traverse units, carousels, AGV's, and machine tools may also be simulated. There is no limit to the number of programmes to be run concurrently on any number of robots or their associated machinery. The resulting command information will be combined by the software to produce one complete integrated simulation. Collision between objects in the work cell are reported as they occur, a critically important feature from the safety point of view.</P>

<P>WORKSPACE calculates the time taken for each event within the model and displays the total as a "cycle time ". By rearranging the work cell or experimenting with different robots and end effectors on the simulation, this cycle time can be reduced to a minimum, thereby maximising the number of production cycles that may be achieved during a working day.</P>

<P>Once the robot program has been defined and evaluated using WORKSPACE it can be down loaded direct to the robot controller without the need to use a postprocessor. Traditional methods of re-programming a robot would inevitably mean that production in that cell must stop for a considerable time. In addition, programming may have been by a teach pendant, involving an unacceptable degree of human error. By first simulating then downloading, downtime can be reduced to the time it takes to load a new program onto the controller from disk. This is one of the major benefits of robot simulation.</P>

<H2>Robot Simulation: Problems and Solutions</H2>

<P>The kinematics involved in robot movement is far more complex that those related to XYZ machining centres, and the relationship between the curves swept by the robot end - effector and the joint variables is not straightforward. Additionally, for a robot simulation to be of general use it must be capable of simulating a wide variety of robot types and configurations. Perhaps because of this the most beneficial simulations are not those that are originally drafted by using a CAD system with additional "robot kinematics" software but those that are specifically designed to cope with the demands of complex robot structures.</P>

<P>To calculate the position of the joints required to achieve a given tool position and orientation it is necessary to use a complex mathematical algorithm. Most simulations provide algorithms for the major robot types. Unfortunately these algorithms do not always function in an identical way to those used on the robot controller ( for example, in the selection of when to point an elbow up or down, or how to deal with degenerate cases when axes are aligned ). Robot manufacturers tend to be reluctant to release information like this (if they know themselves) to a third party simulation company, even under a non-disclosure agreement. This can mean that a robot program can appear satisfactory when simulated on screen can have an occasional unforeseen change of configuration when implemented in the real world. The answer to this that any computer simulation cannot be a substitute for acting with caution the first time a robot cycle is implemented in a work cell, as safety is a primary concern.</P>

<H2>"Off-line" Programming</H2>

<P>WORKSPACE now provides the user with a unique facility for translating from a simulation system language to a robot language. This process is not a simple task. Usually the user would need a post processor to translate not only the simple structures such as movement commands, but also more complex structures such as condition handlers, repeat until, while do,subroutines and variables. There are very few established standards, as the robot manufacturers are fiercely loyal to their own operating systems over those of their competitors.</P>

<P>WORKSPACE uses a highly sophisticated robot simulation language in order to create a compact efficient program. This language contains all the important program structures mentioned above plus a large number of functions and routines which are specific to manipulating robots. For example it is possible to perform a pick and place task by simply naming the object to be moved, specifying the position you wish to place it and calling a routine to calculate all the intermediate moves.</P>

<P>WORKSPACE has a number of robot languages in a library, as with the robots, when performing the simulation and at the start of programming the correct robot language for the model is drawn from the menu and the translation is carried out simultaneously. To transfer the program files from the PC computer running the simulation to the robot controller it is necessary to use a communication link or by copying the files onto a disk compatible with the robot controller. Again, this is an area which has few standards. Even the "standard" RS232 serial port poses problems of electrical wiring and protocol methods. However, once a link has been established it is possible to receive information from the controller and translate into the simulation language without the need of a preprocessor, thus allowing the robot program to be evaluated and improved.</P>

<H2>Model Accuracy</H2>

<P>It must be remembered that a simulation of a robot work cell is only as accurate as the model of the workcell. Careful measurements of objects in the real world must be made, before entering the parameters to the CAD model. One way further of improving the accuracy of a simulation is to use the robot as a measuring device. A probe is attached to the robot endpoint and moved to corners of key positions in the workcell. The datum or calibration points could then be loaded into the model and used to reposition objects in the model relative to the robot.</P>

<H2>Production Time</H2>

<P>When planning a factory lay-out, robot simulation is only part of the story. The values for cycle times given in a workcell assumes that there are no bottlenecks elsewhere in the production process. Scheduling simulations are available to allow the whole flow of materials to be modelled, through modelling robot workcells as "black box" components. What is needed is the complete integration of scheduling and robot simulation, so that ever more accurate figures for average production time may be obtained. WORKSPACE has allowed for this in its'. "User CAll" facility.</P>

<H2>Future Developments</H2>

<P>Simulation has now a major impact on the type of software supplied with robots to users, with most major manufacturers taking a strong interest in marketing their own branded simulations or off-line programming systems. The graphical interface and user friendliness of WORKSPACE has highlighted the inadequacy of todays user-hostile text based robot operating systems. WORKSPACE is capable of running many different robots from different suppliers in the same workcell. It is now possible to use a graphical simulation system used as a robot operating system with a simple "point and click" selection of robot target positions. New robot tasks can be programmed in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.</P>

<P>The promise of flexible automation is yet to be fully realised, but the expectation of the user for simulation software as reliable as the software used for word processing is the target that Robot Simulations Limited set and is achieving.</P>

<i>
Quality health care has never been more important. We have a national health service that is excellent in many ways, particularly for emergencies and General Practitioner service.  For many conditions, however, waiting lists are long and the resources available stretched. Under these circumstances the advantages of private medical treatment become increasingly attractive. Unfortunately, premiums charged for private medical insurance are becoming ever more expensive.
<p>
At </i>MEDICUS <i>we want to ensure that our clients can receive the medical care they need at the time of their choice. We believe it to be of paramount importance that premium levels are affordable and our clients have the freedom to choose the level of benefits that suits both their needs and their budget.
<p>
We have therefore developed a range of Health Care Plans offering cover ranging from basic to extensive and fully comprehensive international protection, all at competitive premium levels. We have achieved this by the introduction of innovative concepts designed to bring the cost of private health care down to an affordable level.<html>

<p>
All MEDICUS Plans are underwritten at Lloyd's. Our client's contract is with Underwriters at Lloyd's.
<p>
MEDICUS has secured the administrative services of Managed Care Consultants Ltd (M.C.C.) to handle all client administration including premium collection, claims procedure and payment of claims. M.C.C. offer professional expertise in the operation of Private Medical Expense Plans.
<p>
The highly experienced MCC team will give our clients the most comprehensive and efficient administrative support.
<p>
Our plans are based on a new form of design, never before seen in the UK. Our leading underwriters at Lloyd's have helped to develop a new pricing structure that not only allows our clients to pay lower premiums for greater benefits but, just as importantly, will help to control future premium increases. Our clients can either use this advantage to acquire fully comprehensive cover at an affordable price or to take a limited form of cover at a remarkably low cost.
<p>
The separation of underwriting and administration from MEDICUS itself creates greater efficiency and cost savings. The use of Preferred Hospitals with procedural pricing agreements helps control costs still further. Efficient claims administration based on pre-claim authorisation handled through MCC' s Counselling Service (see below) is another factor which allows us to offer such highly competitive rates. Every MEDICUS client may select the most suitable level of benefit allowing the principal applicant, spouse and their children to be covered at different levels as necessary. This can help bring down the cost of family cover.
<p>
<h2>COUNSELLING SERVICE</h2>
<p>
Through Managed Care Consultants Ltd., MEDICUS offer their clients a counselling, service staffed exclusively by counsellors with a medical background. This service is designed to help the client through the claims procedure, giving the counsellor the opportunity of speaking directly to the General Practitioner and Specialist where necessary.

<p>
The MEDICUS Child Care Programme offers your family a unique combination of Private Medical Insurance for your children.
It has been designed for the family who require comprehensive protection for their children, without incurring the higher costs associated with comprehensive family cover, or for people in company schemes that do not cover their children.
The levels of cover offered are exceptionally comprehensive giving your children immediate access to private treatment without your being required to pay any part of the cost. These cover levels are not available with budget family plans.
Any child covered through Child Care may, on reaching their 20th birthday, convert their plan into an adult plan. The benefit of this facility, is that all conditions that have occurred during their period of cover under Child Care, will now be covered by their adult plan.
<p>
<i>Designed for the family who require comprehensive protection for their children.
On reaching their 20th birthday, convert their plan into an adult plan with all existing conditions covered.</i>
<p>
<h3><b>How Does It Work?</b></h3>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>You will receive a contract of cover, together with a list of selected hospitals, a
booklet on how to make a claim, and a MEDICUS Identity Card. Keep these in a 
safe place as you will need this documentation when making a claim.
<li>Medical treatment cover will only be valid if you first call a counsellor and 
pre-authorise your claim. As soon as your GP recommends specialist treatment or 
consultation or even hospitalisation, you must speak to a counsellor. If you wish 
to claim for a cash payment, this must also be authorised in advance of treatment.  
So must the covering of parental accommodation.
<li>Remember that your children cannot be covered for a pre-existing or congenital 
condition or any condition arising from pre-existing or congenital conditions.  
Chronic conditions are also excluded. This plan does not cover cosmetic, dental  
or fertility treatment nor does it cover treatment relating to child birth. (For the 
full list of exclusions, refer to the Certificate Wording)
<li>Remember that treatment must take place in a selected hospital unless you have 	
received special pre-authorisation to the contrary. This authorisation is only  
granted for reason of medical necessity.
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>What does it cover?</b></h3>
<br>
Please refer to the Benefit Schedule overleaf for a full description of benefits.
<br>
<h3><b>What does it cost?</b></h3>
<br>
The monthly premium for insuring one child is <b>�20.50</b>.
<br>
<br>
The cost is halved to <b>�10.25</B> for the second and any subsequent children.

<Title>How to Apply</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h1><i>How to Apply</i></h1></center>
<p>
<p>
Check the benefits available with each Plan. Select the most suitable Plan for your needs. Remember if applying on behalf of your family that each individual member can select a different plan.
<p>
As a guide to the benefit schedule the plans available are listed on the page headed 
'The MEDICUS Range of Plans', which should be read carefully before making your choice.
<p>
Check the Premium Schedule for the rate appropriate to your age. You will note that there are two Premium Schedules for each Plan. The first is headed 'Rates for Individuals' and the second 'Membership Rates'. Rates for Individuals indicate the monthly premium for the plan you select. Membership Rates enable you to reduce the overall cost of your plan, however, to qualify for the membership rates you must pay an annual membership premium in the first month of each year as indicated on the rate chart, followed by reduced monthly premiums. This annual premium will automatically be deducted by Direct Debit in the first month of every year of your plan. If you prefer, in the initial year of joining, payment of the membership premium may be made by cheque payable to Medicus Family Care Ltd. Membership reduces the overall cost of insurance over the course of twelve months 
<b>BUT IS NOT REFUNDABLE.</b>
<p>
The CHILD CARE plan, available for parents wishing to cover only their children, has just two rates: �20.50 per month for the first child and �10.25 per month for the second and any subsequent children.
<p>
Add together the monthly premiums selected for each member of your family to determine your total monthly premium. Remember that the direct debit deductions in the first month of each full year of cover will include the annual premium for membership if this option is chosen.<i> (Annual membership premiums may be paid by cheque in the first year).</i>

<Title>Questions and Answers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<center><h2><b>Questions and Answers</b></h2></center>
<p>
MEDICUS is aware that many people, including those currently covered, do not fully understand what Private Medical Insurance really offers. Different plans offer widely differing ranges of protection. The cheapest premiums often indicate very limited cover. It can lead to financial disaster to imagine you are fully covered only to find out too late that you are not. We suggest the following questions 
should always be asked when considering Private Medical Insurance.
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><br>
Q. <b>When I have a legitimate claim do I have to pay any part of that claim myself ?<br><br></b>
A. Some companies ask you to pay the first part of each and every claim. Some companies place limits on the amount you can claim for any particular form of treatment or condition. Although these restrictions will bring down the cost of your insurance, MEDICUS believes this to be the wrong approach and places no limit on claims for eligible treatment and charges no excess on eligible claims. We prefer to
 control costs by efficient and effective administrative procedures.<p>
<li><br>
Q.<b> Am I covered for costs both in and out of hospital ?<br><br></b>
A. Some plans exclude cover unless you are actually in hospital. Some only cover you for treatment that leads to hospitalisation. Although you may be able to afford to pay your own consultancy fees, you should remember that you will probably visit a consultant or have out patient treatment far more often than you are likely to be admitted to hospital. MEDICUS believes out patient specialist consultations
 and out patient treatment to be a major part of full medical cover and puts no limits on the amount you can claim for eligible treatment in these areas.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>Do I qualify for private cover if the NHS can treat me quickly ?<br><br></b>
A. With some plans you do and with some you do not. Many plans only offer cover if the NHS cannot treat you within six weeks. This inevitably means that the more serious conditions tend to be treated by the NHS and your cover does not come into effect. MEDICUS believes that private treatment offers both speed and greater comfort and privacy. When we are seriously ill, that comfort and privacy becomes even
 more important. Speed of treatment is always important, but full cover should also guarantee private treatment for every eligible condition. 
MEDICUS covers you for every eligible condition whether or not the NHS can treat you quickly.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>What is eligible treatment ?<br><br></b>
A. All plans exclude certain conditions. These include chronic illnesses, cosmetic treatment, treatment by a General Practitioner and treatment for self imposed conditions. In these respects, MEDICUS is much in line with other plans. We, naturally, have to exclude a condition that existed prior to application.  
Most plans place you in a hospital �band�. If you want treatment available in the most expensive hospitals you will be asked to pay higher premiums. Many plans exclude the most expensive hospitals altogether. If you choose, or need to be treated in a hospital outside your band, you will be expected to pay the difference in cost yourself. Where your condition is best treated in a hospital outside your 
band this can produce a serious dilemma. You will have either to pay the difference, settle for another hospital or rely on the NHS.<br>
<p>
MEDICUS entitles you to treatment in over 100 nominated hospitals countrywide (see
page 6 for full explanation).
<p>
The only restriction on the consultant you use is that he must be prepared to use one of our Preferred Hospitals. However, if your condition requires you to go to a hospital outside this list, for medical reasons, then subject to prior authorisation, you are fully covered and you pay nothing yourself. We believe this system offers greater protection than the banded system. As long as you understand and use the system correctly you will never have to pay one penny for an eligible claim with PRIORITY CARE, even if your condition requires treatment in the most 
expensive hospital.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>When I need treatment, how can I be sure I am covered ?<br><br></b>
A. Experience has shown that with some plans the answer is that you cannot be sure. Once you have had the treatment and made a claim, there is often little you can do if you discover that for some reason your claim is not eligible.<br>
MEDICUS, through our administrators, offer a counselling service to help with this problem. You must speak to one of our counsellors as soon as your General Practitioner recommends treatment or consultation. In this way your claim is authorised in advance and there is never any chance of unexpected bills.
<li><br>
Q. <b>What happens in the case of a dispute ?<br><br></b>
A. Unlike most plans, with MEDICUS your contract is directly with Lloyd�s Underwriters. This means that should you not agree with any decision made, you have direct access to the Insurance Ombudsman. Of course we hope and believe this will never happen, but it is always comforting to know your rights are independently protected in this way at all times.<br>

<i>
Quality health care has never been more important. We have a national health service that is excellent in many ways, particularly for emergencies and General Practitioner service.  For many conditions, however, waiting lists are long and the resources available stretched. Under these circumstances the advantages of private medical treatment become increasingly attractive. Unfortunately, premiums charged for private medical insurance are becoming ever more expensive.
<p>
At </i>MEDICUS <i>we want to ensure that our clients can receive the medical care they need at the time of their choice. We believe it to be of paramount importance that premium levels are affordable and our clients have the freedom to choose the level of benefits that suits both their needs and their budget.
<p>
We have therefore developed a range of Health Care Plans offering cover ranging from basic to extensive and fully comprehensive international protection, all at competitive premium levels. We have achieved this by the introduction of innovative concepts designed to bring the cost of private health care down to an affordable level.<html>

<Title>Important Information</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h1><i>Important Information</i></h1></center>
<p>
Before you purchase the insurance we are required to bring to your attention a number of important aspects concerning the travel insurance featured in this application.
<p>
<b>Certificate of Insurance</b>
<p>
Should you wish a specimen copy will be made available prior to purchase. Please read this document carefully as it contains the full details of what is and is not covered and the conditions of the cover. Your certificate will be issued upon receipt of the appropriate premium.
<p>
<b>Conditions, Exclusions and Warranties</b>
<p>
These limit or restrict the cover provided. Some apply to all sections of the insurance whilst others only apply to specific sections.
<p>
<b>Health</b>
<p>
The insurance contains conditions that relate to your health and that of others not necessarily travelling with you but upon whose well being the trip may depend. In particular pre-existing medical problems may not always be covered.
<p>
<b>Claims for Personal Baggage</b>
<p>
The insurance does not provide cover on a 'new for old basis'. This means that claims will be paid on the basis of the value of your property at the time of the loss.
<p>
<b>Sums Insured or Limits</b>
<p>
All sections of the insurance have a limit on the amount the Insurer will pay. Some sections have internal limits such as the amount the Insurer will pay for any one item or the total amount for all valuables (including photographic equipment). You are advised to check these limits if you intend taking expensive items with you.
<p>
<b>Excesses</b>
<p>
Under most sections of the insurance, claims will be subject to an excess. This means that you will be responsible for paying part of the claim. The amount you have to pay is the excess.
<p>
<b>Reasonable Care</b>
<p>
You are required to take all reasonable care to protect yourself and your property and to act at all times as though you are not insured.
<p>
<b>High Risk Activities</b>
<p>
The insurance may not cover you when you take part in certain sports or activities where there is a high risk of injury. You must check that the insurance covers your requirements.
<p>
<b>Complaints </b>
<p>
The insurance contains a procedure which tells you what steps to take should you wish to make a complaint.
<p>
<b>Jurisdiction</b>
<p>
The insurance will be subject to English Law unless you and your Insurers agree otherwise.
<p>
<b>'Cooling Off Period' </b>
<p>
If the insurance does not meet your requirements you may return the documentation within 14 days of purchase or prior to travel if this is sooner and provided no claim has been made, obtain a refund
<p>
<b>The Insurers of this Plan are selected syndicates at Lloyd's of London. If you have any doubts concerning the cover provided or you would like more information, please contact Medicus.</b>
